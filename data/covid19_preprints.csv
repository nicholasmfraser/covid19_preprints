Local Chinese news agencies traced back the first confirmed COVID-19 case to Wuhan on 17th of November 2019. This outbreak has later been declared a global pandemic by the WHO since its unexpected spread to several countries including Japan, Iran, South Korea and Italy, leading to respiratory failure, and subsequent death to thousands of victims around the world . [1] Zhou et al., pointed to Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) as the potential functional receptor for SARS- CoV-2 which has been confirmed after by the analysis of the receptor binding motif. [2- 5] ACE-2 was shown to be found in various tissues including the lungs, the brain, the intestines, the liver and the heart, where it is supposed to have beneficial effects to these tissues. [6] This paper aims at addressing the protective roles of ACE-2 in the lungs, based on previous literature and studies on other viruses that also use ACE-2 as a target for cellular entry, and we  hypothesized that COVID-19 pathology may result from viral Mediated down-regulation of ACE-2. In addition, we provided insights on the potential correlation between COVID-19 severity and gender or smoking.</p>"
AfricArXiv (OSF),10.31730/osf.io/sy54p,NA,2020-03-10,THE CAUSE OF PANIC AT THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 IN SOUTH AFRICA – A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH SIMILAR OUTBREAK IN CHINA AND NEW YORK,"<p>Lack of proper messaging at an outbreak of a novel disease causes panic with more serious damaging impacts on livelihoods, social-fabric of communities, economic landscapes, and political stability. There have been notable high levels of panic in South Africa and the globe with regard to the outbreak of COVID-19. The current lack of knowledge and poor communication has been attributed as a precursor to the skyrocketing global panic (Freimuth, Linnan, Potter, 2000).  Fuelling this panic is the rate at which the incidence of new infections is increasing in countries outside of China, with Italy and Iran leading on a number of new infections and death cases.A  Content Analysis method was used to analyze articles, media clips and social network reactions to the outbreak of COVID-19 in South Africa on the 6th of March 2020. The key to the investigation was to understand how authorities are communicating with the public on matters of national concern – regarding how they are prepared to deal and handle the outbreak. This study further compares the South African response to China at the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Codes were generated in targeted media and scientific sources and themes were generated and presented.Findings indicate that the general public does not have faith in government authorities, due to a lack of communication. It is perceived that lack of communication is indicative of a lack of preparedness. Contrary to evident panic in South Africa, scientific data indicates that there is no need to panic as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19. Further, a study from the French Institute for Health and Medical Research in 2020 on the prepardness of African countries to handle COVID-19 indicates that South Africa is one of the better-equipped countries in Africa to detect and handle any incidence of COVID-19. The study recommends that authorities and policy-makers use communications to educate the public far earlier at the onset of epidemic outbreaks, regardless of where it happens as the air-traffic connects global countries, resulting in the potential for disease importation.</p>"

The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to other countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.</jats:p>"

Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel coronavirus’s surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 Å. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the “closed” prefusion S structure, but is accessible in “open” conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>HIGHLIGHTS</jats:title><jats:p>High resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD).</jats:p><jats:p>Recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SARS-CoV antibodies.</jats:p><jats:p>Structure of the SARS-COV-2 RBD in complex with antibody CR3022.</jats:p><jats:p>Identification of a cryptic site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

With the urgent needs to assist the control of the Coronavirus spread and to provide valuable scientific information, we developed a coronavirus database (CoVdb), an online genomics and proteomics analysis platform. Based on public available coronavirus genomic information, the database annotates the genome of every strain and identifies 780 possible ORFs of all strains available in Genebank. In addition, the comprehensive evaluation of all the published genomes of Coronavirus strains, including population genetics analysis, functional analysis and structural analysis on a historical and global scale were presented in the CoVdb.

CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.</jats:p>"

Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-19<jats:sup>1,2</jats:sup>, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and other wildlife species.</jats:p>"

The primer set was adapted by many researchers worldwide and has already contributed to the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this rapidly spreading viral disease. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set amplifies all desired 98 PCR amplicons with fairly small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we also observed an acute drop of reads derived from some amplicons especially amplicon 18 and 76 in “pool 2” as a sample’s viral load decreases. We suspected this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers targeting those two amplicons. Indeed, replacement of just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT, to a newly designed primer resulted in a drastic improvement of coverages at both regions targeted by the amplicons 18 and 76. Given this result, we further replaced four primers in “pool 1” with each respective alternative. These modifications also improved coverage in eight amplicons particularly in samples with low viral load. The results of our experiments clearly indicate that primer dimer formation is one critical cause of coverage bias in ARTIC protocol. Importantly, some of the problematic primers are detectable by observing primer dimers in raw NGS sequence reads and replacing them with alternatives as shown in this study. We expect a continuous improvement of the ARTIC primer set will extend the limit for completion of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to samples with lower viral load, that supports better genomic epidemiology and mitigation of spread of this pathogen.</jats:p>"

However, the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from patients of 2019-nCoV is still unknown. Here we show that after the 2019-nCoV infection, CD4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>CD16<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerates the inflammation. These aberrant and excessive immune cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate with severe lung pathology. Therefore, we suggest that monoclonal antibody that targets the GM-CSF or interleukin 6 receptor may potentially curb immunopathology caused by 2019-nCoV and consequently win more time for virus clearance.</jats:p>"

Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS-CoV-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene <jats:italic>ORF1ab</jats:italic> from the NCBI with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17%, a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the results allow us to identify base pairs sequences that are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and do not appear in other virus strains, that could then be used as a base for designing new primers and examined by experts to extract further insights. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS-CoV-2. At this end the interaction between viromics and <jats:italic>deep learning</jats:italic>, will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic α-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases.

SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes.CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is Amantadine. Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinsons disease. It is available as a generic drug. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway , hence  interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that Amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.</jats:p>"

Symptoma is a symptom-to-disease digital health assistant that can differentiate more than 20,000 diseases with an accuracy of more than 90%. We tested the accuracy of Symptoma to identify COVID-19 using a set of diverse clinical cases combined with case reports of COVID-19. We showed that Symptoma can accurately distinguish COVID-19 in 96.32% of clinical cases. When considering only COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors, Symptoma identified 100% of those infected when presented with only three signs. Lastly, we showed that Symptoma’s accuracy far exceeds that of simple “yes-no” questionnaires widely available online. In summary, Symptoma provides unparalleled accuracy in systematically identifying cases of COVID-19 while also considering over 20,000 other diseases.

An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within COVID-19 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for that virus.</jats:p>

Besides social isolation, identification of the suitable clinically approved drugs to be repurposed could lead to short-term action to reduce mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 major protease (Mpro) is validated target over highly pathogenic CoV. HIV protease inhibitors, like lopinavir (LPV), also inhibit the 2002 SARS-CoV Mpro. However, limited evidence exist whether other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors may bind more efficiently to this enzyme to block SARS-CoV-2 replication. Among these substances, atazanavir (ATV) has documented bioavailability into the respiratory tract, motivating further evaluation on its ability to impair SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we describe that ATV docks stronger to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site than LPV, occupying the substrate cleft in the active side during the entire molecular dynamic analysis. ATV  blocked Mpro activity in cell-free based assays at 10μM. In vitro assays with different cell types, Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and human primary monocytes, confirmed that ATV, combined or not with RTV, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication.

It is caused by a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 with elusive origin. SARS-CoV-2 infects mammalian cells by binding to ACE2, a transmembrane protein. Therefore, the conservation of ACE2 and its expression pattern across mammalian species, which are yet to be comprehensively investigated, may provide valuable insights into tracing potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: We analyzed gene conservation of ACE2 across mammals and collected more than 140 transcriptome datasets from human and common mammalian species, including presumed hosts of SARS-CoV-2 and other animals in close contact with humans. In order to enable comparisons across species and tissues, we used a unified pipeline to quantify and normalize ACE2 expression levels.
Results: We first found high conservation of ACE2 genes among common mammals at both DNA and peptide levels, suggesting that a broad range of mammalian species can potentially be the hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Next, we showed that high level of ACE2 expression in certain human tissues is consistent with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 expressed in a species-specific manner in the mammals examined. Notably, high expression in skin and eyes in cat and dog suggested that these animals may play roles in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.
Conclusions: Through building the first atlas of ACE2 expression in pets and livestock, we identified species and tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding novel insights into the viral transmission.</jats:p>"

We contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) from (i) SARS-CoV2, (ii) the related but less virulent OC43 (Singapore COVID-19 strain), and (iii) the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV1. We find that the RBDs of the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 are highly optimized to achieve the strongest possible binding interaction with ACE2 which is consistent with its enhanced pathogenicity. SARS-CoV2 RBDs form the most stable complex with ACE2 (64.91%, and 28.07% higher binding scores than SARS-CoV1 and OC43, respectively) while occupying the greatest number of residues in the ATR1 binding site. In fact, the spike protein RBDs from SARS-CoV2 out-compete the angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 64% in terms of binding affinity (quantified using the Rosetta scoring function). They accomplish this through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alpha-helix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.</jats:p>"

This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.</jats:p>"

RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and S associate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins confer excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in a unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation of coronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 Å proximal to viral membrane.

Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract, including goblet cells, club cells, and alveolar type 2 cells. Chronic smoke exposure triggers a protective expansion of mucus-secreting goblet cells and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking causes a decrease in lung ACE2 levels.

For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.</jats:p>"

The phylogeny of the genomes yields some interesting results. Systematic gene level mutational analysis of the genomes has enabled us to identify several unique features of the SARS-CoV2 genome, which includes a unique mutation in the spike surface glycoprotein (A930V (24351C&gt;T)) in the Indian SARS-CoV2, absent in other strains studied here. We have also predicted the impact of the mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability, using computational approach. To gain further insights into host responses to viral infection, we predict that antiviral host-miRNAs may be controlling the viral pathogenesis. Our analysis reveals nine host miRNAs which can potentially target SARS-CoV2 genes. Interestingly, the nine miRNAs do not have targets in SARS and MERS genomes.

The severe respiratory pneumonia caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 has so far claimed more than 14,500 lives and has impacted human lives worldwide. Development of universal vaccines against the novel SARS-CoV-2 holds utmost urgency to control COVID19 pandemic that appears to be more severe than any of the previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS). However, as the novel SARS-CoV-2 displays high transmission rates, the underlying severity hidden in the SARS-CoV2 genomes is required to be fully understood. We studied the complete genomes of 95 strains of SARS-CoV-2 reported from different geographical regions worldwide to uncover the pattern of spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 across the globe. We show that there is no direct transmission pattern of the virus among neighbouring countries suggesting that the outbreak is a result of travel of infected humans to different countries. We revealed unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16 (present in ORF1b polyprotein region) and S-Protein within 10 viral isolates from USA. These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication and processing, indicating highly evolved strains of the novel SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the population of USA than in other countries. Furthermore, we found an isolate from USA (MT188341) to carry frameshift mutation between positions 2540 and 2570 of nsp16 which functions as mRNA cap-1 methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). Thus, we reason that the replicative machinery of the novel SARS-CoV-2 is fast evolving to evade host challenges and survival. These mutations are needed to be considered, otherwise it will be difficult to develop effective treatment strategies. The two proteins also had dN/dS values approaching 1-ORF1ab polyprotein (dN/dS= 0.996, 0.575) and S protein (dN/dS= 0.88) and might confer selective advantage to the virus.

Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure.

While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects.  Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of  SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3' and 5' UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen.</jats:p>"

Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compare with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (-53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic.</jats:p>"

The SARS-CoV-2 was found to be closely related to the SARS-CoV, based on the genomic analysis. The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 as well, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to the human ACE2. Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined complex structures. Plausible binding modes between human ACE2 and the RBD were revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data further revealed critical residues at the complex interface and provided more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Two mutants mimicking rat ACE2 were modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations showed that the N-terminal helix and the K353 of the human ACE2 alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to the ACE2.</jats:p>"

OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.</jats:p>"

Our literature and clinical trial survey showed that the whole virus, as well as the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and membrane protein, have been tested for vaccine development against SARS and MERS. We further used the Vaxign reverse vaccinology tool and the newly developed Vaxign-ML machine learning tool to predict COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The N protein was found to be conserved in the more pathogenic strains (SARS/MERS/COVID-19), but not in the other human coronaviruses that mostly cause mild symptoms. By investigating the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, six proteins, including the S protein and five non-structural proteins (nsp3, 3CL-pro, and nsp8-10) were predicted to be adhesins, which are crucial to the viral adhering and host invasion. The S, nsp3, and nsp8 proteins were also predicted by Vaxign-ML to induce high protective antigenicity. Besides the commonly used S protein, the nsp3 protein has not been tested in any coronavirus vaccine studies and was selected for further investigation. The nsp3 was found to be more conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV than among 15 coronaviruses infecting human and other animals. The protein was also predicted to contain promiscuous MHC-I and MHC-II T-cell epitopes, and linear B-cell epitopes localized in specific locations and functional domains of the protein.

We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses is rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether these non-neutralizing antibody responses will lead to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future.

The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion.

Till date, no vaccine or completely effective drug is available to cure COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed. This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as targets and different epitopes (B-cell, T-cell and IFN-γ inducing) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the world’s population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the MEV. The antigenicity, allergenicity, physiochemical properties and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> cloning of MEV ensured increased expression in the <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> K-12 system.

The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population [1], and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus [2]. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation [1].

By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.</jats:p>"

We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor.

In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the view, pangolin acted as an intermediate host, may be controversial. The network indicated that, in the original haplotype (H14), one patient sample lived near the Huanan seafood market (approximate 2 km), indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. However, based on this clue, we cannot accurately concluded that whether this market was the origin center of SARS-CoV-2.

Two notable features have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (1) the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2; (2) a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids (PRRA) at the S1 and S2 boundary. For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution. The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.</jats:p>"

Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar GA rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology.

Detailed investigation of S protein with various immunoinformatics tools enabled us to identify 5 MHC I and 5 MHC II B-cell derived T-cell epitopes with VaxiJen score &gt; 1 and IC50 value &lt; 100nM. These epitopes were joined with a suitable adjuvant and appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope based vaccine construct.

Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the positive rate is only 30-50%. Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to “The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)” issued by National Health and Commission of China and “The Experts’ Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV” released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56°C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 °C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 °C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hank’s solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 °C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.</jats:p>"

The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017.

These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans.

Nucleotide and di-nucleotide compositions displayed bias toward A/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) analysis revealed 8 common putative preferred codons among all the 13 isolates. Interestingly, all of the latter codons are A/U-ended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1). Cluster analysis (based on RSCU values) was performed and showed comparable results to the phylogenetic analysis (based on their whole genome sequences) indicating that the CUB pattern may reflect the evolutionary relationship between the tested isolates. To investigate the force (mutation and/or selection) influencing the pattern of CUB in SARS-CoV-2 coding sequences, we employed the following; (i). Effective number of codons (ENc), (ii). ENc-GC3 plot, (iii). Neutrality plot, and (iv) Codon adaptation index (CAI). According to their results, natural selection and/or other factors (not investigated in this study) may be the dominant force driving SARS-CoV-2 CUB. It is also worth mentioning that, by using the most expressed genes in human lung tissues as a reference set, some viral genes such as Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, ORF7a protein, and surface glycoprotein had high CAI values which may indicate for selection force acting on their codon usage, as they play important roles in viral assembly and may help viruses avoid the host immune system. The outcome of our study may help in understanding the underlying factors involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the interactions with their host.

Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with the phylogeny analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of human engineering.

We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus and may also regulate interspecies transmission.

Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2.

We further identify mature small intestinal enterocytes as a possible hotspot of COVID-19 fecal-oral transmission, where an intriguing maturation-correlated transcriptional signature is shared between ACE2 and the other coronavirus receptors DPP4 (MERS-CoV) and ANPEP (α-coronavirus).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a receptor of 2019-nCoV spike 1 protein (S1) and mediates viral entry into host cells. Despite the abundance of ACE2 in small intestine, few digestive symptoms are observed in patients infected by 2019-nCoV. Herein, we investigated the interactions between ACE2 and human defensins (HDs) specifically secreted by intestinal Paneth cells. The lectin-like HD5, rather than HD6, bound ACE2 with a high affinity of 39.3 nM and weakened the subsequent recruitment of 2019-nCoV S1. The cloak of HD5 on the ligand-binding domain of ACE2 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation. A remarkable dose-dependent preventive effect of HD5 on 2019-nCoV S1 binding to intestinal epithelial cells was further evidenced by in vitro experiments. Our findings unmasked the innate defense function of lectin-like intestinal defensin against 2019-nCoV, which may provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.</jats:p>"

Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection.

We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.</jats:p>"

This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp.

Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an urgent need to understand the biological behavior of the virus and provide a basis for developing effective therapies. Since the proteome of the virus was determined, some of the protein structures could be determined experimentally, and others were predicted via template-based modeling approaches. However, tertiary structures for several proteins are still not available from experiment nor they could be accurately predicted by template-based modeling because of lack of close homolog structures. Previous efforts to predict structures for these proteins include efforts by DeepMind and the Zhang group via machine learning-based structure prediction methods, i.e. AlphaFold and C-I-TASSER. However, the predicted models vary greatly and have not yet been subjected to refinement. Here, we are reporting new predictions from our in-house structure prediction pipeline. The pipeline takes advantage of inter-residue contact predictions from trRosetta, a machine learning-based method. The predicted models were further improved by applying molecular dynamics simulation-based refinement. We also took the AlphaFold models and refined them by applying the same refinement method.

With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.</jats:p>"

Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes.

It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2.

Due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome to identify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potential immunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted that showed affinity with the 34 most popular HLA alleles in Chinese population. Based on these epitopes, 30 vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity, human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. Majority of vaccine peptides contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent HLA alleles accounting for ~99% of Chinese population. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. In conclusion, these putative antigenic peptides may elicit the resistance response to the viral infection. In vitro and in vivo experiments are required to validate the effectiveness of these peptide vaccine.</jats:p>"

Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells.

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV).

While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, “MyCoV”, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Importance Statement</jats:title><jats:p>The analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses.

Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package ‘MyCoV’ which classifies user generated sequences.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

The disease is caused by a newly identified coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an urgent need to identify antivirals to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we report the remarkable sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to recombinant human interferons α and β (IFNα/β). Treatment with IFN-α or IFN-β at a concentration of 50 international units (IU) per milliliter drastically reduce viral titers by 3.4 log or 4.5 log, respectively in Vero cells. The EC50 of IFN-α and IFN-β treatment is 1.35 IU/ml and 0.76 IU/ml, respectively, in Vero cells. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive to many other human pathogenic viruses, including the SARS-CoV.

Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.</jats:p>"

SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.</jats:p>"

Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. A critical question for treatment and protection is why it appears that the severity of infection may correlate with the initial level of virus exposure. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable ""choke points"" for pharmacologic interactions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate response dynamics. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung and intestinal tissue that will be iteratively refined. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and interactive, cloud-hosted executables in under 12 hours. In a sustained community effort, this model will integrate data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.</jats:p>"

Bats and pangolins are suspected as the reservoir and the intermediate host. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein plays the key role in the tight binding to human receptor ACE2 for viral entry. Here, we analyzed the worldwide RBD mutants and found 18 mutant strains fell into 8 mutation types under high positive selection pressure during the spread. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K<jats:sub>D</jats:sub>) of three types of RBD mutants emerging in Wuhan, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and France were two orders of magnitude lower than the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 strain due to the stabilization of the beta-sheet scaffold of the RBD. This indicated that the mutated viruses may have evolved to acquire remarkably increased infectivity. Five France isolates and one Hong Kong isolate shared the same RBD mutation enhancing the binding affinity, which suggested that they may have originated as a novel sub-lineage. The K<jats:sub>D</jats:sub> values for the bat and the pangolin SARS-like CoV RBDs indicated that it would be difficult for bat SARS-like CoV to infect humans; however, the pangolin CoV is potentially infectious to humans with respect to its RBD. These analyses of critical RBD mutations provide further insights into the evolutionary trend of SARS-CoV-2 under high selection pressure. The enhancement of the SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 reveals a possible higher risk of more severe virus transmissions during a sustained pandemic of COVID-19 if no effective precautions are implemented.</jats:p>"

A recent study investigated translatome and proteome host cell changes induced in vitro by SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we use the publicly available proteomics data from this study to re-analyze the mechanisms altered by the virus infection by impact pathways analysis and network analysis. Proteins linked to inflammatory response, but also proteins related to chromosome segregation during mitosis, were found to be regulated.

Molecular dynamic simulations revealed long-range covariant movements of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein monomer in pre-fusion conformation with furin cleavage, and residue T333, under purifying selection, hinge of such movement.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.</jats:p>"

Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the SARS-CoV-2 involving the RBD. As a result of this recombination event, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a similar genotype in RBD, including two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), and alleles 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts with the human ACE2 receptor. Ancestral state analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with RaTG13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the RBD. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus whereby the SARS-CoV-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the RBD.</jats:p>"

However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of “relapse” or “reinfection”. The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection.

The current shortage of this RNA extraction kit during this pandemic has resulted in a severe bottleneck in testing capacity. To address this problem, we tested two alternative strategies: the use of alternative RNA extraction kits or a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits an RNA extraction step altogether.

In this report, we evaluate type-I Interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment. Examining transcriptional factor activation and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, SARS-CoV-2 in the context of type I IFN induces phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased ISG proteins. In contrast, the original SARS-CoV has no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation or ISG protein increases even in the presence of type I IFN pretreatment.

Understanding the humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins may help identify biomarkers that can be used to detect and treat COVID-19 infection. However, no immuno-proteomics platform exists that can perform such proteome-wide analysis. To address this need, we created a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray to analyze antibody interactions at amino acid resolution by spotting peptides 15 amino acids long with 5-amino acid offsets representing full-length SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Moreover, the array processing time is short (1.5 hours), the dynamic range is ∼2 orders of magnitude, and the lowest limit of detection is 94 pg/mL. Here, the SARS-CoV-2 proteome array reveals that antibodies commercially available for SARS-CoV-1 proteins can also target SARS-CoV-2 proteins. These readily available reagents could be used immediately in COVID-19 research. Second, IgM and IgG immunogenic epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were profiled in the serum of ten COVID-19 patients. Such epitope biomarkers provide insight into the immune response to COVID-19 and are potential targets for COVID-19 diagnosis and vaccine development. Finally, serological antibodies that may neutralize viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor were identified. Further investigation into whether these antibodies can inhibit the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted. Antibody and epitope profiling in response to COVID-19 is possible with our peptide-based SARS-COV-2 proteome microarray. The data gleaned from the array could provide invaluable information to the scientific community to understand, detect, and treat COVID-19.</jats:p>"

In the respiratory tract, these targets are ciliated cells. Interestingly, various reports indicate an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia, suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue, but that might also include the olfactory sensory epithelium. We explored this possibility by generating RNA-seq libraries from human neuroepithelium, in which we found significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. To determine whether specific cell types of this chemosensory tissue may coexpress both of the virus entry genes, we analyzed a scRNA-seq dataset.

This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat variants of the coronaviruses to infect human cells.</jats:p>"

The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with high antigenicity, safety and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants were utilized to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans.

Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs.

Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the β-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, <jats:italic>ORF3a</jats:italic>, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors.

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.</jats:p>"

These VHHs are capable of potently neutralizing MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses. The crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs block receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S, and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH is capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion.

SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a +RNA virus that encodes four structural proteins - the matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) - and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N-terminal RNA binding domain (N-NTD) captures the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein.

FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins.

DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift.

With over 200,000 confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD co-crystal structure, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) α1 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, we chemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD α1 helix composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of this human derived sequence was complete in 1.5 hours and after work up and isolation &gt;20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layer interferometry revealed that this peptide specifically associates with the SARS-CoV-2-RBD with low nanomolar affinity. This peptide binder to SARS-CoV-2-RBD provides new avenues for COVID-19 treatment and diagnostic modalities by blocking the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 and thus precluding virus entry into human cells.</jats:p>"

A multitude of research efforts worldwide aim at characterizing the cellular factors involved in viral transmission in order to reveal therapeutic targets. For a full understanding of the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary. The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and its expression has been reported in various human organs, in some cases with inconsistent or contradictory results. Here, we aim to verify a reliable expression profile of ACE2 in all major human tissues and cell types. Based on stringently validated immunohistochemical analysis and high-throughput mRNA sequencing from several datasets, we found that ACE2 expression is mainly localized to microvilli of the intestinal tract and renal proximal tubules, gallbladder epithelium, testicular Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, glandular cells of seminal vesicle and cardiomyocytes. The expression in several other previously reported locations, including alveolar type II (AT2) cells, could not be confirmed. Furthermore, ACE2 expression was absent in the AT2 lung carcinoma cell line A549, often used as a model for viral replication studies.

Here we report that CoV-2 Mpro is however 300% more sensitive than CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cyst-145, and coincides with the binding site of several of its inhibitors.

Tenofovir and emtricitabine are the two components in DESCOVY and TRUVADA, the two FDA-approved medications for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. This is a preventative method in which individuals who are HIV negative (but at high-risk of contracting the virus) take the combination drug daily to reduce the chance of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP can stop HIV from replicating and spreading throughout the body. We report here that the triphosphates of tenofovir and emtricitabine, the two components in DESCOVY and TRUVADA, act as terminators for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp catalyzed reaction.

We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection.

This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (<jats:italic>i.e.</jats:italic> thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA.

We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-kB repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients.

Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.</jats:p>"

World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted that the COVID-19 is a pandemic now. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied Human SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners.

The intensification of the COVID-19 epidemic overwhelms limited clinical resources in particular, but not only, in developing countries, resulting in many patients not being tested for the infection and in large queues of potentially infected individuals waiting to be tested while providing a breeding ground for the disease. We describe here a rapid, highly sensitive, point-of-care, molecular test amenable for use at home, in the clinic, and at points of entry by minimally trained individuals and with minimal instrumentation. Our test is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification (COVID-19 LAMP) and for higher sensitivity on nested nucleic acid, two stage isothermal amplification (COVID-19 Penn-RAMP). Both tests can be carried out in closed tubes with either fluorescence or colorimetric (e.g., leuco crystal violet LCV) detection. COVID-19 LAMP performs on par with COVID-19 RT-PCR.

First, we sought to identify existing FDA approved drugs that could block coronaviruses from entering cells by binding to ACE2 or TMPRSS2 using a high-throughput AI-based binding affinity prediction platform. Top results included several ACE inhibitors, a beta-lactam antibiotic, two antiviral agents (Fosamprenavir and Emricasan) and glutathione. The platform also assessed specificity for ACE2 over ACE1, important for avoiding counterregulatory effects. Further studies are needed to weigh the benefit of blocking virus entry against potential counterregulatory effects and possible protective effects of ACE2. However, the data herein suggest readily available drugs that warrant experimental evaluation to assess potential benefit. Second, we sought to identify FDA approved drugs that could attenuate the gene expression patterns induced by coronaviruses, using our Disease Cancelling Technology (DCT) platform.  DCT was run on an animal model of SARS-CoV, and ranked compounds by their ability to induce gene expression signals that counteract disease-associated signals.  Top hits included Vitamin E, ruxolitinib, and glutamine. Glutathione and its precursor glutamine were highly ranked by two independent methods, suggesting both warrant further investigation for potential benefit against SARS-CoV-2.

The virus is a positive-strand RNA virus with high homology to bat coronavirus. Due to the limits of the existing experimental tools, many protein roles of novel coronavirus including ORF8 are still unclear. Therefore, in the current scene of an emergency epidemic, it is of high scientific significance to predict the biological role of viral proteins through bioinformatics methods. In this study, conserved domain analysis, homology modeling, and molecular docking were used to compare the biological roles of certain proteins of the novel coronavirus. The results showed the ORF8 and surface glycoprotein could bind to the porphyrin, respectively, while orf1ab, ORF10 and ORF3a proteins could coordinately attack heme to dissociate the iron to form the porphyrin. The mechanism seriously interfered with the normal heme anabolic pathway of the human body, being expected to result in human disease. According to the validation analysis of these finds, Chloroquine could prevent orf1ab, ORF3a and ORF10 to attack the heme to form the porphyrin, and inhibit the binding of ORF8 and surface glycoproteins to porphyrins to a certain extent.

efficient drugs and identifying target proteins are still an unmet but urgent need
for curing COVID-19. Protein structure based docking is a widely applied
approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for
predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has
its inherent deficiency caused by, e.g., various different conformations with
largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target
proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results.
As a complementary approach to the protein structure based platform for
COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our recent work, we developed the ligand-based
method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity
evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound
database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules against
the coronaviruses SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, some of which have target or
mechanism information but some don’t. Based on the two-dimensional and
three-dimensional similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual
screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking
results. With two examples, we demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of D3Similarity
for drug discovery and target prediction against COVID-19. D3Similarity is

up-stream regulatory elements, their expression and functions in human body,

Vitamin D and Quercetin activities and their established safety records as

Recently, this lab has shown that steroid hormones are structurally symmetric with each of the four DNA nucleotide pairs and through an ionic binding process may enable gene transcription.  Here, a new code is developed for DNA nucleotide sequences that relates to the  initiation site for gene transcription.  The structural code consists of the orientation of  steroid molecules in  binding to DNA nucleotides and the class of steroid molecules that form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with an available functional group of Thymine.  This later class thereby describes a steroid hormone-DNA nucleotide-ion complex with three hydrogen bonds for A-T and T-A, which thereby matches the three internal hydrogen bonds associated with C-G and G-C.  The code consists of two binary vectors to characterize the four configurations of DNA nucleotides and is shown to be consistent with known regulatory elements of DNA sequences associated with gene transcription, including the TATA box and the E-Box, along with other promoters.  In addition, the code, which is bijective, is applied to analyze the DNA sequence associated with SARS-CoV-2 to identify regions with relevant structural characteristics.</jats:p>"

of the most important 2019-nCoV protein targets is the 3C-like protease for which the crystal
structure is known. Most of the immediate efforts are focused on drug repurposing of known
clinically-approved drugs and virtual screening for the molecules available from chemical libraries
that may not work well. For example, the IC50 of lopinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, against the
3C-like protease is approximately 50 micromolar. In an attempt to address this challenge, on

druglike compounds generated using these approaches are being published at

Two druggable targets, namely 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) were selected in this study due to their indispensable nature in the viral life cycle. 3CLpro is a cysteine protease responsible for the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins resulting in the formation of various functional proteins, whereas 2'-O-MTase methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the first and second nucleotide of viral mRNA, which sequesters it from the host immune system.

Two promising drug molecules were identified for each protein based on their estimated free energy of binding (ΔG), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the interacting residues.

As a result, highly sensitive, reliable and field-deployable methods to detect 2019-nCoV that can be developed in a shortest possible time are urgently needed. In this work, we introduce whole-course encapsulated and ultrasensitive field detection methods against 2019-nCoV gene. We applied isothermal exponential amplification methods via reverse transcription plus subsequent enzymatic recombinase amplification (ERA), a modified recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), to amplify trace level of 2019-nCoV RNA. We designed both exo FRET probe and nfo affinity probe for easy detection of the amplified nucleic acids. These methods can be developed within a few days and as low as 0.32 aM (i.e. 0.32×10-18 M) of RNA can be reliably detected.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;</jats:p>"

The COVID-19 pandemic reveals just how serious governments take this responsibility and that restricting activity to limit pathogen spread can have other public health repercussions. Comparisons between February 2019 and 2020 air quality measures reveal that six cities that were impacted early by government restrictions in response to COVID-19 show consistent declines in five of six major air pollutants. Given that air pollution causes more than four million premature deaths annually, the declines in air pollution in response to activity changes confirm that governments have the capability to improve air quality through policy change.</p>"

EcoEvoRxiv (OSF),10.32942/osf.io/mr6pn,NA,2020-03-28,On the inadequacy of species distribution models for modelling the spread of SARS-CoV-2: response to Araújo and Naimi,"<p>The ongoing pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing significant damage to public health and economic livelihoods, and is putting significant strains on healthcare services globally.  This unfolding emergency has prompted the preparation and dissemination of the article “Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus likely to be constrained by climate” by Araújo and Naimi (2020).  The authors present the results of an ensemble forecast made from a suite of species distribution models (SDMs), where they attempt to predict the suitability of the climate for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 over the coming months.  They argue that climate is likely to be a primary regulator for the spread of the infection and that people in warm-temperate and cold climates are more vulnerable than those in tropical and arid climates.  A central finding of their study is that the possibility of a synchronous global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely.  Whilst we understand that the motivations behind producing such work are grounded in trying to be helpful, we demonstrate here that there are clear conceptual and methodological deficiencies with their study that render their results and conclusions invalid.What follows is a response to the Araújo and Naimi article centered around three main criticisms:1) Given the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has a primary infection pathway of direct contact, it is in an active spreading phase, and remains largely underreported in the Global South, it represents an inappropriate system for analysis using the SDM framework.2) Even if we were to accept that an SDM framework would be applicable here, the methodology presented in the article strays far from best-practice guidelines for the application of SDMs.3) The dissemination strategy of the authors failed to respect the frameworks of risks adhered to in other academic disciplines pertaining to public health, resulting in erroneous but well-publicised claims with broad policy implications before any scientific oversight could be applied.</p>"

No lab team can be prepared for something like a pandemic such as COVID-19, which has led to shuttered labs around the globe. But many other types of crises can also arise that labs may have to weather during their lifetime. What can researchers do to make a lab more resilient in the face of such exterior forces? What systems or behaviors could we adjust in ‘normal’ times that promote lab success, and increase the chances that the lab will stay on its trajectory? We offer 10 rules, based on our current experiences as a lab group adapting to crisis.</p>"

Like other members of this family, the virus  possesses a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. The genome encodes for the nsp12 protein, which houses the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity responsible for the replication of the viral genome. A homology model of nsp12 was prepared using the structure of the SARS nsp12 (6NUR) as a model. The model was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp12. This exercise showed that vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) may bind to the active site of the nsp12 protein. A model of the nsp12 in complex with substrate RNA and incoming NTP showed that Vitamin B12 binding site overlaps with that of the incoming nucleotide. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA plus NTP and methylcobalamin suggested that the vitamin may bind to the active site of nsp12 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that methylcobalamin binding may prevent association with RNA and NTP and thus inhibit the RdRP activity of nsp12. Overall, our computational studies suggest that methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp12 protein.</p>"

                        <p>The outbreak of a coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) which is associated with respiratory-related illness and high mortality presents a major worldwide need. Problems of information availability to health care providers; difficulties in diagnosis and disease prognosis; and a lack of monitoring tools are some of the obstacles faced by the clinical community. Most importantly, the lack of valid therapies makes the pandemic a devastating universal problem. Current information points to a concept of dysregulation of the immune system which is unable to mount an effective anti-viral response, and on the other hand induces an uncontrolled immune-mediated response manifesting as ARDS, myocarditis and hepatitis.

                        <p>The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak demonstrates the need for novel applications of real-time data to produce timely information about incident cases. Using health information technology (HIT) and real-world data, we sought to produce an interface that could, in near real-time, identify patients presenting with suspected respiratory tract infection (RTI) and enable monitoring of test results related to specific pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This tool was built upon our computational health platform (CHP), which provides access to near real-time data from disparate HIT sources across our health system. This combination of technology allowed us to rapidly prototype, iterate, and deploy a platform to support a cohesive organizational response to a rapidly evolving outbreak. Platforms that allow for agile analytics are needed to keep pace with evolving needs within the healthcare system.</p>

                    <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                        <p>When a novel coronavirus (e.g., COVID -19) starts to spread, one of the many questions asked is with regards to the trend of new confirmed cases increasing or decreasing during the on-going outbreak epidemic. Finding the turning point of the outbreak spread (i.e., from ascending to declining status) is continuously an urgent concern. Due to different weights (e.g.., an extremely high proportion of confirmed cases in Hubei, China) of the cases confirmed in countries/regions, using either the overall total number or a partially small portion of the infected-case regions to determine the turning point (e.g., the trend to decline) is problematic and unreliable. Rasch analysis used for examining individual performances of school students was thus considered as a tool to inspect the epidemic trend through the pattern of item (e.g., day in epidemic) difficulties over days.</p>

                    <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                        <p>At the end of February 2020, the virus spread rapidly in South Korea, following its initial outbreak in China, making Korea the new center of global attention. The role of social media amid the current Coronavirus pandemic have often been criticized, little systematic research has yet been conducted on this issue. Social media functions as a convenient source of information in pandemic situations.</p>

                        <p>Few infodemiology studies have applied network analysis in conjunction with content analysis. This study investigates information transmission networks and news sharing behaviors regarding the Coronavirus on Twitter in Korea. Overcoming the crisis requires diverse forms of data and more complex models. The real time aggregation of social media data can serve as a starting point for designing strategic messages for health campaigns and establishing an effective communication system during this Coronavirus outbreak.</p>

                        <p>Korea’s Coronavirus Twitter data were collected on February 29, 2020. Our final sample comprised 43,832 users and 78,233 conversations. We generated four networks in terms of key issues regarding the Coronavirus in Korea. This study comparatively investigates how Coronavirus-related issues circulated on Twitter by conducting network analysis. Next, we classify top news channels shared in tweets. Lastly, we conducted content analysis of news frames used in the top shared sources.</p>

                    <title>RESULTS</title>
                        <p>The network analysis (78,233 conversations generated by 43,832 users) suggest that the spread of information was faster in the Coronavirus network than in the other networks (Corona19, Shincheon, and Daegu). People who used the word ‘Coronavirus’ communicated more frequently with each other. The spread of information was faster, and the diameter value is the lowest than did those who used other terms. Many news items appeared highlighting the positive role of individuals and groups, directing readers’ attention to the epidemic crisis. Ethical issues such as deviant behavior among the population and an entertainment frame highlighting celebrity’s donation also often emerged. There was significant difference in using non-portal (n = 14) or portal news (n = 26) sites between the four network types (N= 40). News frames used in top sources were similar across the networks (p = .89). Tweets containing medically framed news articles were found to be more popular than tweets that included news articles adopting non-medical frames (N = 40, p = .03).</p>

                        <p>We find that most of the popular news on the Twitter had non-medical frames. Nevertheless, the spillover effect of the news articles that delivered medical information about Coronavirus was greater than that of news with non-medical frames. While social media network analytics cannot replace the work of public health officials, monitoring public conversations and media news that propagates rapidly can assist public health professionals in their complex and fast-paced decision-making processes.</p>

                        <p>In this paper, in response to the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) in China in early 2020, a model was established based on the daily immigration population data of provinces / municipalities in China and the daily number of newly diagnosed patients in each region. Offset and time window, which are the model parameters used for the best fit between the daily risk coefficient and daily number of newly diagnosed patients, is used as the effect assessment of the external and internal migration control. The results show that the prevention and control of Fujian and some other regions is relatively good, but Heilongjiang and some other regions are not good. The accuracy of the model has been confirmed from many aspects such as theory, data, and news.</p>

                        <p>In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73%) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75%). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was “wash your hands frequently” (n=65, 81%). A less frequent recommendation was to “stay home if you feel unwell” (n=26, 33%). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39). According to the country of publication (Spain versus the United States), significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations such as “wash your hands frequently” (OR 9.82), “cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze” (OR 4.59), or “stay home if you feel unwell” (OR 0.31).</p>

                        <p>The ratio of males and females were 3.25∶1. 25 cases of Han nationality of Chinese. 22 cases (84.62%) were more than 18 years old. There were 15 cases from the local area (57.69%), and 6 cases were from Hubei province (23.08%). There were 20(76.92%) cases of fever, 14(53.85%) cases of weakness, and 8(30.77%) cases of dry cough. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) therapy could help covid-19 patients overcome anxiety and sleep problems, which may give a boost in their mental strength to fight against this covid-19 during the staying isolation ward. Both the clinical results and quality of evidence will reveal for Ribavirin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Moxifloxacin and Arbidol Hydrochloride combination with supportive drugs are probably major effective treatments in this study challenges that face frontline physicians who treat patients in a medical setting and evaluate prophylaxis for novel high-risk environments formed by large quarantined and isolated populations.</p>

                        <p>As the medical landscape changes daily with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, clinical researchers are caught off-guard and are forced to make decisions on research visits in their on-going clinical trials. Although there is some guidance from local and national organizations, the Principal Investigator (PI) is ultimately responsible for determining the risk-benefit ratio of conducting, rescheduling, or cancelling each research visit. The PI should take into consideration the ethical principles of research, local/national guidance, the community risk of the pandemic in their locale, staffing strain, and the risk involved to each participant to ultimately decide the course of action. While balancing the rights and protection of the human subject, we seldom examine patient’s views and opinions about their scheduled research visit(s). 
This article discusses ethical principles of beneficence and autonomy in helping the decision process. We discuss ways to weigh-in local and national guidance, staffing strain, and institutional support into the decision process and outline potential changes needed for regulatory bodies depending on the decision. Further, discussion about the need to weigh in the individual risk-benefit ratio for each participant and present a decision tree to navigate this complex process. Finally, we examine participant and caregiver perspectives on their fears, sense of preparedness and factors that they weigh before deciding whether to keep or postpone the research appointments. This entry also provides the Principal Investigator ways to support the research participants in both scenarios including provision of psychological support.</p>

To demonstrate its use, we modelled similar intervention scenarios to those recently reported by other investigators using various model types, as well as several novel strategies. The modelled strategies involve isolation of cases, moderate social distancing and stricter population “lock-downs” enacted over varying time periods, in a hypothetical population of 100,000 people.</p>

                        <p>COVOID allocates each member of its hypothetical population to one of seven compartments. The number of times individuals in the various compartments interact with each other and their probability of transmitting infection at each interaction can be varied to simulate the effects of interventions. Using COVOID, we were able to replicate the epidemic response patterns to specific social distancing intervention scenarios reported by other investigators. In six novel intervention scenarios, involving ramp-up of self-isolation and social distancing, the COVID-19 epidemic curve is both substantially flattened and “shrunk”. A scenario of early and rapid case finding and strict enforcement of isolation results in almost complete suppression of the epidemic. Scenarios of moderate social isolation and lockdown result in large reductions in cases and deaths, but “rebound” may occur after these measures are relaxed, unless intensive case-finding and strict enforcement of isolation are enacted.</p>

                        <p>This study included a total of 368 dentists aged from 22 to 73 year with a mean (SD) of 32.9 (10.6) year. A total of 112 (30.4%) had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or received lectures regarding COVID-19. A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days. The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of how to identify patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it is necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission.

                        <p>
Jordanian dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, infection control and measures in dental clinic.  However, dentists had limited comprehension of the extra precautionary measures that protect the dental staff and other patients from COVID-19. National and international guidelines should be sent by the regional and national dental associations to all registered dentists during crisis, including this COVID -19 pandemic, to make sure that dentists are well informed and aware of the best practices and recommended disease management approaches. </p>

                        <p>Public health emergencies like epidemics put enormous pressure on health care systems, while revealing deep structural and functional problems in the organization of care. The current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates this at a global level. The sudden increased demand on delivery systems puts unique pressures on pre-established care pathways.  These extraordinary times require efficient tools for smart governance and resource allocation.</p>

                    <title>RESULTS</title>
                        <p>The Crisis Management Platform was developed and offered to health authorities in British Columbia on a non-profit basis. It has the capability to dramatically streamline patient intake, triage, monitoring, referral, and delivery of non-hospital services. It decentralizes provision of services (by moving them online), and centralizes data gathering and analysis, maximizing utilization of existing human resources, facilitating evidence-based decision-making, and minimizing the risk to both users and providers. It has unlimited scale-up possibilities (only con-strained by HHRR availability) with minimal marginal cost. Similar web-based solutions have the potential to fill an urgent gap in resource allocation, becoming a unique asset for health systems governance and management during critical times. They highlight the potential effectiveness of web-based solutions if built on an outcome-driven architecture.</p>

                        <p>We adopted the uses and gratifications theory to reveal the principle in information dissemination of the official accounts. Two-wave data, comprising the number of followers from the top 200 official accounts on 21 January 2020 and 27 January 2020, were used to calculate the increase. We selected them during the seven-day period as the first dependent variable. The total number of likes from headlines on the epidemic in this period was selected as the second dependent variable. The number of each type of articles and headlines about the coronavirus served as the independent variables. The above data were used to develop multiple and simple linear regression models. We used content analysis to explore other factors affecting users’ behaviour.</p>

                        <p>The top 200 official accounts can be classified to institution, medicine and individual groups. For institution and medicine groups, the adjusted R2 value in the multiple linear regression model were 0.355 and 0.452, respectively. For the institution group, the adjusted R2 value in the simple linear regression model was 0.317. The other results were insignificant, and we could not develop an ideal model for them. However, the above R2 value indicated a good fit. For the institution group, report and story types of articles were significant for the multiple linear regression model (B=2.724, P=.007; B=14.875, P=.003), and both were identified positive effects. For the simple linear regression model, the number of headlines on coronavirus was identified positive effect (B=3.084, P&lt;.001). For the medicine group, report and science types were significant for the multiple linear regression model (B=4.381, P=.009; B=31.564, P&lt;.001) and had a positive effect.</p>

                    <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                        <p>The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics. With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19. At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC’s surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.</p>

                                <sec>
                    <title>METHODS</title>
                        <p>The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly. This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this. (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)—with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care. (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups. This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test. The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance. (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples. (5) Data curation. We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed. Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories.</p>

                        <p>General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance. Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs.

                        <p>We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy. The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported. Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.</p>

                        <p> Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the epidemic of COVID-19 were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported COVID-19 patients. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline-visit motivation were detected within each counselees’ group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical seeking behaviors. The counselees’ motivation and the doctors’ recommendation for offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees’ tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline-visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed and the corresponding effects were discussed.</p>

                    <title>RESULTS</title>
                        <p>4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees 28 years (inter-quartile range: 22-33 years). There were 104(2.1%) healthy counselees, 147(3.0%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34(0.7%) exposed counselees, 853(17.4%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42(0.9%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550(72.3%) highly suspicious counselees and 183(3.7%) severely suspicious counselees. 94.2% counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion mode (44.1%) was common. The counselees’ motivation and the doctors’ recommendation for offline visit were inconsistent (P&lt;0.001) with Cohen Kappa score 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (OR=1.816, P&lt;0.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR= 7.568, P&lt;0.001), shortness of breath (OR=1.440, P=0.001), diarrhea (OR=1.272, P=0.04) and unrelated symptoms (OR=1.509, P&lt;0.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR= 2.303, P&lt;0.001), fever (OR= 1.660, P&lt;0.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR=1.440, P=0.012) and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR= 4.826, P&lt;0.001) were more likely to attempt for offline visit. Re-attendant counselees (OR=0.545, P=0.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic. </p>

                        <p>Data was collected from the online courses’ statistical data and metrics reporting system on the OpenWHO platform. User patterns and locations were analysed based on Google Analytics and the platform's own statistics capabilities, with data sets overlaid. This analysis was conducted based on user location, with the data disaggregated according to the six WHO regions, their top 10 countries and the proportion of use for each language version. Data includes affiliation, gender, age and other parameters for approximately 30% of users who indicated their background.</p>

                        <p>As of 25 March 2020, the introductory COVID-19 course totals 232 890 enrolments across all languages. The Spanish language course comprises more than half (51%) of all course enrolments, while the English language course comprises 37% of enrolments. WHO’s Region of the Americas accounts for most of the course enrolments, with more than 72% across all languages. Other regions are more evenly distributed with less than 10% each. 32.4% of users specified professional affiliation by choosing from the 12 most common backgrounds in OpenWHO’s user profiles. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, users were spread over the 11 distinct affiliations with small fractions of users identifying themselves as “Other”. With the COVID-19 introductory course, the largest number of users selected “Other” (31.7%) suggesting a large non-health professional and academic user load. The top 10 countries of users across all languages are Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Mexico, Peru, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</p>

                        <p>The online course has addressed a global learning need by providing WHO technical guidance packaged in simple formats for access and use. The learning material development was expedited to meet the onset of the epidemic. Initial data suggests that the various language versions of the course, in particular Spanish, have reached new user groups, fulfilling the platform’s aim of providing learning everywhere to anyone interested. User surveys will be carried out to measure real impact.</p>

                    <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                        <p>Studies agree that we are only at the beginning of an unprecedented health crisis affecting the population and especially older adults. In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important because if the problem is lower for adults, it is more complicated for older adults. They need to stay at home because they are most at risk of Covid-19 infection. However, physical activity (PA) represents the most effective method for preventing falls among older adults.</p>

                        <p>Our team is wondering about the impact of stopping group physical activities on the autonomy level of older adults in this quarantine period and which alternatives could be suggested to this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle.</p>

                        <p>We conducted a qualitative survey by semi-structured interviews with three managers in charge of PA programs for older adults at the departmental level. We also interviewed five sports trainers who run these PA programs.</p>

                    <title>RESULTS</title>
                        <p>All participants interviewed (N=8) told us that before the quarantine measures and because of the Covid-19 epidemic, attendance at physical activity workshops had declined. Older adults who were no longer attending the workshops preferred to abstain to avoid contact with other participants and potentially to Covid-19. Interviewees expressed concern that shutting down these activities could isolate some seniors. The structure’s heads related that there is an alternative for older adults to practice physical activity at home.</p>

                                <sec>

                        <p>Physical activity is important for older adults, particularly to preserve their level of autonomy.
It seems necessary to reflect on global communication for older adults to the significance to maintain a physical activity practice at home and to introduce the online tools provided. Quarantine and “social distancing” will exacerbate the epidemic of sedentary lifestyles previously found in older adults.</p>

                        <p>As the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has expanded payments for telehealth services in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an increased population interest in telehealth and healthcare facilities now convert regular in-person visits to telehealth visits. Expansion of telehealth services is expected to alleviate the overload of healthcare system while delivering timely care for the initial screening of symptomatic patients. However, telecommunication infrastructures in US hospitals may lack the capability to address the ongoing healthcare needs of patients with other health conditions. More practical investment is needed to deploy the telehealth system rapidly against the impending patient surge.</p>

                        <p>A short survey explored a possibility to use technology to contain highly infectious diseases through GPS data sharing. Since privacy is often the very first hurdle that many researchers need to clear in personal data collection, we probed one of the basic and yet crucial questions: what do people feel about sharing GPS data to mitigate the spread of highly infectious diseases? Through M-Turk, 484 people completed our survey. The vast majority of them (73%) felt it is necessary to share their own GPS data if they were infected with the disease. Similarly, 77% of them felt it is necessary for others to share their GPS data when they are infected, as long as their identity was protected. Thus, our results show that people are, very often, willing to share their GPS data in an effort to contain highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19, as long as their privacy is protected. Our conclusion indicates the great potential to use novel approaches to tackle with highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19.</p>

                    <title>RESULTS</title>
                        <p>A total of 18161 questionnaires were returned, including 6% (1171) from Wuhan City. Geographical distributions of the responders were consistent with prevalence per province (R² = 0.64, P &lt; .001). History of contact significantly decreased with time, both outside Wuhan City (R² = 0.35, P = .002) and outside the Hubei Province (R² = 0.42, P &lt; .001). Percentage of fever responders peaked around 08 February (R² = 0.57, P &lt; .001) and increased with history of contact in the areas outside Wuhan City (odds ratio: 1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.06 - 1.48, P = .009). Male, advanced age, history of contact with wildlife animals, and comorbidities including lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, stroke and chronic kidney disease, increased the risk of fever in the general population with a history of contact.</p>

                    <title>UNSTRUCTURED</title>
                        <p>Background: Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. Facing this kind of public health emergency, an efficient, fast and group communication method is needed. 
Method: As a director of the department Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in a tertiary hospitals, which is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in a medium-sized city,  I analyzed and summarized the “group function” of WeChat (Weixin, micro-message) App in working about COVID-19. 
Results: By February 16, 2020, we have completed 1,526 citywide consultations and treatment of 322 inpatients, including 97 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with the help of 12 WeChat groups by handy. The advantages of WeChat group are as follows: 1. Work efficiency can be improved greatly, saving labor costs.  2. Accurate and intuitive information can be gotten fast and timely, avoiding close contacting with COVID-19 patients.  3. Data and message in WeChat groups can be saved, arranged and reviewed at any time.
Conclusions: The “group function” in WeChat App plays a greater role in the public health emergent work about management, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.</p>

                    <title>UNSTRUCTURED</title>
                        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) have a high vulnerability and variable capacity to respond to outbreaks. Many of these countries addressed the need for increasing capacity in the areas of surveillance and rapid response to public health threats. Moreover, countries addressed the need for communication strategies that direct the public to actions for self- and community protection. This viewpoint article aims to highlight the contribution of the Global Health Development (GHD)/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) and the EMR’s Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETPs) to prepare for and respond to the current COVID-19 threat. GHD/EMPHNET has the scientific expertise to contribute to elevating the level of country alert and preparedness in the EMR and to provide technical support through health promotion, training and training materials, guidelines, coordination, and communication. The FETPs are currently actively participating in surveillance and screening at the ports of entry, development of communication materials and guidelines, and sharing information to health professionals and the public. However, some countries remain ill-equipped, have poor diagnostic capacity, and are in need of further capacity development in response to public health threats. It is essential that GHD/EMPHNET and FETPs continue building the capacity to respond to COVID-19 and intensify support for preparedness and response to public health emergencies.</p>

                        <p>Previous epidemic management research proves the importance of city-level information, but also highlights limited expertise in urban data applications during a pandemic outbreak. In this paper, we provide an overview of city-level information, in combination with analytical and operational capacity, that define urban intelligence for supporting response to disease outbreaks. We present five components (movement, facilities, people, information, engagement) that have been previously investigated but remain siloed to successfully orchestrate an integrated pandemic response. Reflecting on the COVID-19 outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan, China, we discuss the opportunities, technical challenges, and foreseeable controversies for deploying urban intelligence during a pandemic. Finally, we emphasize the urgency of building urban intelligence through cross-disciplinary research and collaborative practice at the global scale.</p>

                        <p>A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between £15,000 and £74,999. US and UK participants’ median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was “highly effective” in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p>

                        <p>Background: From December 2019, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia broke out in Wuhan, China. In this study, we present the finding of serial computed tomography in a female patient with 2019-nCoV.
Case presentation: We report a 40-year-old female who presented with the symptoms of fever, chest tightness, and fatigue. She was further diagnosed with 2019-nCoV confirmed by rRT-PCR. In terms of her chest CT findings, patchy consolidation shadows, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) rapidly progressed in both lungs, peripherally. After treatment, the	previous lesions were almost absorbed, leaving the fibrous lesions.
Conclusions: If there is a history of fever or contact with the epidemic area, combined with the above CT findings, it is necessary to detect the nucleic acid of new coronavirus in time.</p>

Despite traditional forms of transmission of this virus (droplets and aerosols in medical facilities), new evidence suggests aerosols forming patterns in the atmosphere as a main vector of community transmission outside medical spaces. Following these findings, for the observed constant community transmission, the focus was on main parameters for dynamic mathematical simulations and epidemiological predictions, as previously introduced by Gu et al., for outside propagation of the virus.Uninfected individual and social distancing aspects, of one to two meters of physical distance, were statistically analysed among countries from January to March 2020, and countries were divided into those implementing social distancing and those implementing full social transmission isolation (with masks and city disinfection). Considering new infected daily cases that occur in outside spaces with virus community spreading and the total cases worldwide, correlations were made about the use of social isolation, COVID-19 confirmation tests with the masks/respirator use, and city disinfection preventive methods and the results show that social distancing aspects could act as a vector of COVID-19 transmission with respect to atmosphere carrier potential. In this sense, the virus association with human social transmission behaviour (host) caused by the social distancing framework might represent a main model for the constant reproductive spread patterns of COVID-19 within community transmission. Finally, the findings have important implications for the policy making to be adopted globally as well as individual-scale preventive methods.</p>"

However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of  T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.</jats:p>"

We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment.
Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir.
The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.</jats:p>"

Although a number of antiviral agents have been evaluated for coronaviruses there are no approved drugs available. To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials.

Methods:
A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms “2019-nCoV”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Hcov-19”, “new coronavirus”, “novel coronavirus”. We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents.

Findings:
Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the trials were randomized with parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IQR, 36-120). Open-label studies were the most frequent (46%) followed by double-blind (13%) and single blind studies (10%). The most frequently assessed therapies were: stem cells therapy (n=23 trials), lopinavir/ritonavir (n=15), chloroquine (n=11), umifenovir (n=9), hydroxychloroquine (n=7), plasma treatment (n=7), favipiravir (n=7), methylprednisolone (n=5), and remdesivir (n=5). Remdesivir was tested in 5 trials with a median of 400 (IQR, 394-453) planned inclusions per trial, while stem cells therapy was tested in 23 trials, but had a median of 40 (IQR, 23-60) planned inclusions per trial. Lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with the highest total number of planned inclusions (2606) followed by remdesivir (2155). Only 52% of the clinical trials reported the treatment dose (n=60) and only 34% (n=39) the duration. The primary outcome was clinical in 76 studies (66%), virological in 27 (23%); radiological in 9 (8%) or immunological in three studies (3%).
  
Interpretation:
Numerous clinical trials have been registered since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, however, a number of information regarding drugs or trial design were lacking.

However, seldom study focused on confirmed and unconfirmed groups. Our aim was to compare clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside Hubei province between confirmed and unconfirmed group.
Methods We retrospectively enrolled 163 consecutive adult patients with suspected COVID-19 from three tertiary hospitals in two provinces outside Hubei province from January 12, 2020 to February 13, 2020 and the differences in epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics between the two groups were compared.
Results This study enrolled 163 patients with 62 confirmed cases and 101 unconfirmed cases. Most confirmed patients were clustered (31, 50.0%) and with definite  epidemiological exposure. Symptoms of COVID-19 were nonspecific, largely fever and dry cough. Laboratory findings in confirmed group were characterized by normal or reduced white blood cell count, reduced the absolute value of lymphocytes, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and accelerated Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The typical chest CT imaging features of patients with confirmed COVID-19 were peripherally distributed multifocal GGO with predominance in the lower lung lobe. Compared with unconfirmed patients, confirmed patients had significantly higher proportion of dry cough, leucopenia, lymphopenia and accelerated ESR (P&lt;0.05); but not with alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, and myoglobin (P&gt;0.05). Proportion of peripheral, bilateral or lower lung distribution and multi-lobe involvement, GGO, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram and pleural thickening in the confirmed group were also higher (P&lt;0.05).
Conclusions Symptoms of COVID-19 were nonspecific. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and ESR, as well as chest CT could be used as a clue for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Methods: A total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The plasma of these patients were collected during hospitalization and were detected for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Afterwards, the difference of IgG antibody between male and female patients was analyzed.
Results:
The level of IgG antibody in mild, general and recovering patients showed on difference between male and female. In severe status, the average IgG antibody level in female patients tended to be higher than that of in male patients. Compared with male patients, most of the female patients generated a relatively high level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in severe status. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female tended to be stronger than male patients in disease early phase.
Conclusions:
The inconsistent of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody generation in male and female patients may account for the different outcome of COVID-19 between gender.</jats:p>"

Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift. Moreover, the formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.</jats:p>"

Reproductive trends and the stability of the SARS-COV-2 infection in a city can then be analyzed, and the uncontrollable risks can be forecasted before they really happen. The infection mechanism of a city is depicted using the philosophy of cybernetics and approaches of the control engineering. Distinguished with other epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, etc., that compute the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population, CDIM considers the immigration and emigration population as system inputs, and administrative and medical resources as dynamic control variables. The epidemic regulation can be simulated in the model to support the decision-making for containing the outbreak. City case studies are demonstrated for verification and validation.</jats:p>"

However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.</jats:p>"

Policy decisions depend on such predictions but they vary widely.  On the other hand much empirical information is already contained in the data of evolving epidemiological profiles.  We show, both with evidence from data, and theoretically, how the ratio of daily infected and recovered cases can be used to track and predict the course of the epidemic.  Ability to predict the turning points and the end of the epidemic  is of crucial importance for fighting the epidemic and planning for a return to normalcy. The accuracy of the prediction of the peaks of the epidemic is validated using data in different regions in China showing the effects of different levels of quarantine. The validated tool can be applied to other countries where Covid-19 has spread, and generally to future epidemics. A preliminary prediction for South Korea is made with limited data, with end of the epidemic as early as the second week of April, surprisingly.</jats:p>"

Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard but it is time consuming with significant false negative results. Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we aimed to develop a deep learning method that could extract COVID-19's graphical features in order to provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. 
Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images that first two nucleic acid test results were negative, 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with the accuracy of 85.2%.

In Italy, the magnitude and increasing trend of the case-fatality risk (CFR) is fueling the already high levels of public alarm. In this paper, we highlight that the widely used crude CFR is an inaccurate measure of the disease severity since the pandemic is still unfolding. With the goal to improve its comparability over time and across countries at this stage, we then propose a demographic adjustment of the CFR that addresses the bias arising from differential case ascertainment by age. When applied to publicly released data for Italy, we show that until March 16 our adjusted CFR was similar to that of Wuhan, the most affected Chinese region, where COVID-19 has now been contained. This indicates that our adjusted CFR improves its comparability over time, making an important tool to chart the course of the COVID-19 pandemic across countries. Since March 16, the Italian COVID-19 outbreak has entered a new phase, with the northern and southern regions following different trajectories. As a result, our adjusted CFR has been increasing between March 16 and March 20. Data at the subnational level are needed to correctly assess the disease severity in the country at this stage.</jats:p>"

Design: A retrospective descriptive study

Setting: China

Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis.

Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government,  epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. 

Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where &gt;50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died.

Conclusion: Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction.

We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) between hospitals within NHS trusts, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We coarse-grain the NHS system at the level of NHS trusts and, subsequently cover the whole set of geopositioned trusts to extract a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates, for a given trust, its four nearest neighbors. Estimates of weekly ICU demand can be extrapolated from an age structured epidemiological model by considering contagion-to-ICU likelihood estimates, and through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy. The cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity and we implement and test two optimisation strategies. Our framework is flexible allowing for additional criteria, different cost functions, and this methodology is general enough that it can easily be extended to optimise other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand across trusts, we show that using our method it is possible to enable access to ICU treatment to up to 1000 cases nationally in a single step of the algorithm, leading to potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU if no load sharing was implemented.</jats:p>"

We show preliminary results from a survey of over 38,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Researchers from the U.S, Spain, and Italy have adopted our approach and we are collaborating to further improve it. We call with urgency for other countries to join this international consortium, and to share methods and data collected from these daily, simple, one-minute surveys.</jats:p>"

Fast diagnosis of COVID-19, and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resources optimization is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography.
    We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images and gene information were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features. Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system.
    In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014). Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings.

Here we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California using samples from returning travelers, cruise ship passengers, and cases of community transmission with unclear infection sources. Virus genomes were sampled from 29 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from Feb 3rd through Mar 15th. Phylogenetic analyses revealed at least 8 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting multiple independent introductions of the virus into the state. Virus genomes from passengers on two consecutive excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic in Washington State, including the WA1 genome representing the first reported case in the United States on January 19th. We also detected evidence for presumptive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from one community to another. These findings suggest that cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California to date is characterized by multiple transmission chains that originate via distinct introductions from international and interstate travel, rather than widespread community transmission of a single predominant lineage.

Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. The mortality of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases is very high. Facing this kind of public health emergency, high efficient administrative emergency responsive mode in designated hospital is needed.
Method: 
As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, our hospital is the only designated one for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a medium-sized city. Novel coronavirus pneumonia department, which is administrative led by the president of hospital directly, has been established at early stage of epidemic crisis in my hospital. In NCP department, there are core members of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Don't stick to national guidelines of NCP, based on professional opinion by respiratory professor and expert group, we focused on individualized treatment and timely adjustment of treatment and management strategies in working about COVID-19 patients.
Results: 
1. High working efficiency: By Mar 02, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19.  2. Excellent therapeutic effect：Among 101 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, all were cured and discharged, except for one death. No secondary hospital infection, no pipeline infection and no pressure sore were found in all patients.  3. Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 prior to official release conference: Strengthened protection is key point to zero infection in healthcare group and medical faculty and lower rate of second generation infectious patients. 4. Timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: The first evidence of digestive tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 has been carried out in our hospital. 
Conclusions:
In our hospital, establishment of NCP department, which is administratively led by the president of hospital directly and specialized conduct by respiratory professor, is the key to success in management and treatment of COVID-19 patients. This hospital emergency responsive mode could provide reference for other hospitals and cities in epidemic situation.</jats:p>"

At the current stage, fast, accurate and early clinical assessment of the disease severity is vital. To support decision making and logistical planning in healthcare systems, this study leverages a database of blood samples from 404 infected patients in the region of Wuhan, China to identify crucial predictive biomarkers of disease severity. For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the survival of individual patients with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this paper suggests a simple and operable formula to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritised and potentially reducing the mortality rate.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model.
Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: &lt;= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: &gt;= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: &lt;= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: &gt;= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). 
Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (χ2 = 4.99 × 10-6, P &gt; 0.999), and five age groups (χ2 = 4.85 × 10-6, P &gt; 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons).
Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.</jats:p>"

As of 20 March 2020, cases have been reported in 166 countries/regions, including cases of human-to-human transmission around the world. The proportions of this epidemics is probably one of the largest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. According to the current epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number, R_0 ~ 2.3, number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals, as well as an asymptomatic period (up to 14 days) in which infectious individuals are undetectable without further analysis, pave the way for a major crisis of the national health capacity systems.
Recent scientific reports have pointed out that the detected cases of COVID19 at young ages is strikingly short and that lethality is concentrated at large ages.
Here we adapt a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) metapopulation mobility model to capture the spread of COVID-19. We propose a model that stratifies the population by ages, and account for the different incidences of the disease at each strata. The model is used to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population through time, permitting investigation of control measures.
The model is applied to the current epidemic in Spain, using the estimates of the epidemiological parameters and the mobility and demographic census data of the national institute of statistics (INE). The results indicate that the peak of incidence will happen in the first half of April 2020 in absence of mobility restrictions. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and can be adapted to precise mobility restrictions at the level of municipalities. The current estimates largely compromises the Spanish health capacity system, in particular that for intensive care units, from the end of March. However, the model allows for the scrutiny of containment measures that can be used for health authorities to forecast with accuracy their impact in prevalence of COVID--19. Here we show by testing different epidemic containment scenarios that we urge to enforce total lockdown to avoid a massive collapse of the Spanish national health system.</jats:p>"

It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.</jats:p>"

COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China caught the world by surprise. As the outbreak began to spread outside of China, too little was known about the virus to model its transmission with any acceptable accuracy. World governments responded to rampant minformation about the virus leading to collatoral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available.

This is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. The most sought after estimate is the projected number of people who may be contagious, but still be within the incubation period thus remaining asymptomatic and undetected. This parameter is useful for estimating the extent of outbreak among a population over time and what to expect. It is thus important for common sense decision making by governments, organizations, and even individuals to contain, prepare, prevent, react, and safeguard. A Monte Carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and a variable, called testing efficiency as variables.

The Coronavirus outbreak in USA will be used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach. Among others it is demonstrated that imposing early travel restrictions from infected countries slowed down the outbreak in the USA  by about 26 days.</jats:p>"

However, infection with COVID-19 is currently rare in children.
Objective To discuss the latest findings and research focus on the basis of characteristics of children confirmed with COVID-19, and provide an insight into the future treatment and research direction.

Methods: We searched the terms ""COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2"" AND ""Pediatric OR children"" on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, NIH, CDC, and CNKI. The authors also reviewed the guidelines published on Chinese CDC and Chinese NHC.

Results: We included 25 published literature references related to the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, accessary examination, treatment, and prognosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19.

Conclusion: The numbers of children with COVID‐19 pneumonia infection are small, and most of them come from family aggregation. Symptoms are mainly mild or even asymptomatic, which allow children to be a risk factor for transmission. Thus, strict epidemiological history screening is needed for early diagnosis and segregation. This holds especially for infants, who are more susceptible to infection than other age groups in pediatric age, but have most likely subtle and unspecific symptoms. They need to be paid more attention to. CT examination is a necessity for screening the suspected cases, because most of the pediatric patients are mild cases, and plain chest X-ray do not usually show the lesions or the detailed features. Therefore, early chest CT examination combined with pathogenic detection is a recommended clinical diagnosis scheme in children. The risk factors which may suggest severe or critical progress for children are: Fast respiratory rate and/or; lethargy and drowsiness mental state and/or; lactate progressively increasing and/or; imaging showed bilateral or multi lobed infiltration, pleural effusion or rapidly expending of lesions in a short period of time and/or; less than 3 months old or those who underly diseases. For those critical pediatric patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, polypnea may be the most common symptom. For treatment, the elevated PCT seen in children in contrast to adults suggests that the underlying coinfection/secondary infection may be more common in pediatric patients and appropriate antibacterial treatment should be considered. Once cytokine storm is found in these patients, anti-autoimmune or blood-purifying therapy should be given in time. Furthermore, effective isolation measures and appropriate psychological comfort need to be provided timely.</jats:p>"

The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020. 
Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package.
Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases.

Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses.

We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses.
 
We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27,  and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21.

In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.</jats:p>"

We created an interactive, quantitative model that forecasts demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization based on county-level population characteristics, data from the literature on COVID-19, and data from online repositories. Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The online model is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists. The model is actively being used by several academic medical centers and policy makers, and we believe that broader access will continue to aid community and hospital leaders in their response to COVID-19.</jats:p>"

In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concern, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the efficacy of containment, mitigation or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to quarantined populations in order to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the 17 individual regions (CCAA). Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follows an evolution similar to the isolation of 1.5 percent of the population and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum over 1.4M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown, but increasing the isolation around ten times more could  drastically reduce the peak to over 100K cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents an 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid an Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than halve the number of deaths.</jats:p>"

Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized at Tongji and Mobile Cabin Hospitals from Jan 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020. Sex differences in severity and composite endpoints (admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death) of COVID-19 patients were compared. The correlation analysis and cox/logistic regression modeling of menstruation status/sex hormones and prognosis were conducted. Correlation between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity or estradiol (E2) was revealed.Results Chi square test indicated significant differences in distribution of composite endpoints (p&lt;0.01) and disease severity (p=0.05) between male and female patients (n=1902). 435 female COVID-19 patients with menstruation records were recruited. By the end of Mar 8, 111 patients recovered and discharged (25.3%). Multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for age and severity indicated that post-menopausal patients show the greater risk of hospitalization time than non-menopausal patients (relative hazard [RH], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46)Logistic regression model showed that higher AMH as a control for age increases the risk of severity of COVID-19 (HR=0.146, 95%CI= (0.026-0.824) p=0.029). E2 showed protective effect against disease severity (HR=0.335, 95%CI= (0.105-1.070), p=0.046).In the Mann-Whitney U test, the higher levels of IL6 and IL8 were found in severe group (p=0.040, 0.033).The higher levels of IL2R, IL6, IL8 and IL10 were also observed in patients with composite end points(p＜0.001,＜0.001, =0.009, = 0.040).E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL2R, IL6, IL8 and TNFα in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033, 0.048, 0.054, 0.023) and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651; p=0.030). Conclusions and Relevance Menopause is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. E2 and AMH are negatively correlated with COVID-19 severity probably due to their regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation.</jats:p>"

Two previous case series from China have suggested that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, but the reports were limited by small numbers and few clinical information.
Objective: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. 
Design: Retrospective study.
Setting: Four designated COVID-16 hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
Participants: Medical records of 67 cancer patients admitted to hospitals between Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were included.
Measurements: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Survival data of the cohort was cut-off on Mar 10, 2020.
Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (P&lt;0.001). Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, and the proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). 
Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient.
Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19.</jats:p>"

This study sought to elucidate a novel predictor of disease severity in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cased by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: Patients enrolled in this study were all hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities, demographic data, and laboratory and radiological data were reviewed. The outcomes of patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe pneumonia were compared using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to explore clinical characteristics and risk factors. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to screen optimal predictors from the risk factors and the predictive power was verified by internal validation.
Results: A total of 377 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study, including 117 with severe pneumonia and 260 with non-severe pneumonia. The independent risk factors for severe pneumonia were age [odds ratio (OR): 1.059, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.082; p &lt; 0.001], N/L (OR: 1.322, 95% CI: 1.180-1.481; p &lt; 0.001), CRP (OR: 1.231, 95% CI: 1.129-1.341; p = 0.002), and D-dimer (OR: 1.059, 95% CI: 1.013-1.107; p = 0.011). We identified a product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer as having an important predictive value for the severity of COVID-19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value  of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value  was 46.03% in the test sets.

It may give the public some scientific information to ease the fear of the epidemic.
Objective: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation.
Design: According to all diagnosis number from WHO website and combining with the transmission mode of infectious diseases, the mathematical model was fitted to predict future trend of outbreak.
Setting: Our model was based on the epidemic situation in China, which could provide referential significance for disease prediction in other countries, and provide clues for prevention and intervention of relevant health authorities. 
Participants: In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website.
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): We develop a simple but accurate formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:N_i/N_(i-1) =[(N_(i-1)/N_(i-2) )]^α，where Ni is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, and α was estimated as 0.904 at Feb 10.
Results: Based on this model, it is predicted that the rate of disease infection will decrease exponentially. The total number of infected people is limited; thus, the disease will have limited impact. However, new diagnosis will last to March.
Conclusions and Relevance: Through the establishment of our model, we can better predict the trend of the epidemic in China.</jats:p>"

We developed and validated a diagnosis aid model without CT images for early identification of suspected COVID-19 pneumonia (S-COVID-19-P) on admission in adult fever patients and made the validated model available via an online triage calculator. Patients admitted from Jan 14 to Feb 26, 2020 with the epidemiological history of exposure to COVID-19 were included [Model development (n = 132) and validation (n = 32)]. Candidate features included clinical symptoms, routine laboratory tests and other clinical information on admission. Features selection and model development were based on Lasso regression. The primary outcome is the development and validation of a diagnosis aid model for S-COVID-19-P early identification on admission. The development cohort contains 26 S-COVID-19-P and 7 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The model performance in held-out testing set and validation cohort resulted in AUCs of 0.841 and 0.938, F-1 score of 0.571 and 0.667, recall of 1.000 and 1.000, specificity of 0.727 and 0.778, and the precision of 0.400 and 0.500.

The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively.

Many have implemented nationwide stringent control to avoid overburdening the health care system. This paralyzes economic and social activities until the availability of a vaccine, which may take years. We propose an alternative exit strategy to develop herd immunity in a predictable and controllable way: a phased lift of control. This means that successive parts of the country (e.g. provinces) stop stringent control, and Covid-19-related IC admissions are distributed over the country as the whole. Importantly, vulnerable individuals need to be shielded until herd immunity has developed in their area. We explore the characteristics and duration of this strategy using a novel individual-based model for geographically stratified transmission of Covid-19 in a country. The model predicts that individuals will have to experience stringent control for about 14 months on average, but this duration may be significantly shortened by future developments (more IC beds, better drugs). Clearly, the strategy will have a profound impact on individuals and society, and should therefore be considered carefully by various other disciplines (e.g. health systems, ethics, economics) before actual implementation.</jats:p>"

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. 
Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens.
Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive.
Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay.

Control measures, based on isolation and quarantine, have been shown to decrease and delay the burden of the ongoing epidemic. With respect to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, recent modelling work shows that this intervention technique may be inadequate to control local outbreaks, even when perfect isolation is assumed. Furthermore, the effect of  infectiousness prior to symptom onset combined with a significant proportion of asymptomatic infectees further complicates the use of contact tracing. Antivirals, which decrease the viral load and reduce the infectiousness, could be integrated in the control measures in order to augment the feasibility of controlling the epidemic.
Methods: Using a simulation-based model of viral transmission we tested the efficacy of different intervention measures for the control of COVID-19. For individuals that were identified through contact tracing, we evaluate two procedures: monitoring individuals for symptoms onset and testing of individuals. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a potent antiviral compound on the contact tracing process. 
Findings: The use of an antiviral drug, in combination with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, results in a significant decrease of the final size, the peak incidence, and increases the probability that the outbreak will fade out.
Interpretation: For an infectious disease in which presymptomatic infections are plausible, an intervention measure based on contact tracing performs better when realized together with testing instead of monitoring, provided that the test is able to detect infections during the incubation period. In addition, in all tested scenarios, the model highlights the benefits of the administration of an antiviral drug in addition to quarantine, isolation and contact tracing. The resulting control measure, could be an effective strategy to control local and re-emerging outbreaks of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

While molecular assays to directly detect the viral genetic material are available for the diagnosis of acute infection, we currently lack serological assays suitable to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. 
Methods: Here we describe serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that we developed using recombinant antigens derived from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. These assays were developed with negative control samples representing pre-COVID 19 background immunity in the general population and samples from COVID19 patients.
Results: The assays are sensitive and specific, allowing for screening and identification of COVID19 seroconverters using human plasma/serum as early as 3 days post symptom onset. Importantly, these assays do not require handling of infectious virus, can be adjusted to detect different antibody types and are amendable to scaling.
Conclusion: Serological assays are of critical importance to determine seroprevalence in a given population, define previous exposure and identify highly reactive human donors for the generation of convalescent serum as therapeutic. Sensitive and specific identification of coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 antibody titers will also support screening of health care workers to identify those who are already immune and can be deployed to care for infected patients minimizing the risk of viral spread to colleagues and other patients.</jats:p>"

Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.</jats:p>"

To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.</jats:p>"

To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (T<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) &amp; maximal infection number (I<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results. 

<jats:bold>Method</jats:bold>: Inspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks. The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two secondary parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or dark biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (I<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (T<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>).

Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P&lt;10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model.

The impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health challenge seem to be the most serious regarding respiratory viruses since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In the absence of effective vaccine or biomedical treatment, the basic rules of public health measures have not changed, namely public distancing.
Methods:
We analyzed epidemiological investigation reports during the first month of the outbreak in Israel. In addition, we present a deterministic compartment model and simulations of several scenarios emphasizing quarantine and isolation policies given their efficiency. 
Results:
We identify an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an exponential growth (R_0= 2.19) in light of the actual policy-makers decisions and public behavior in Israel. Our analysis show that before the abrupt change, the new cases trend was due to returning citizens infected abroad. The abrupt change followed a holiday in which social distancing was clearly inefficient and many public gatherings were held. We further discuss three different modeled scenarios of quarantine efficiency: high-, medium-, and low-efficiency. 
Conclusions:
Israel early lessons show that there is no allowance to compromise with the directive of social distancing. Even before the onset of the pandemic in Israel, fine-tuned but determined early decisions were taken by policy makers to monitor flight arrivals from Covid-19 affected regions and to limit public gatherings. Our analysis show that one particular holiday has shifted the occurrence curve from controlled regime to exponential growth. Therefore, even a short lapse in public responsiveness can have a dramatic effect.</jats:p>"

Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.</jats:p>"

An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named CoVID-19, was first reported in China on 31 December 2019. As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England.  

Methods:
We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. 

Results: 
We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established.  Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. 

Discussion:
We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.</jats:p>"

This study aims to understand the global pandemic geospatial patterns and trends and identify new epicenters requiring urgent attention.
Methods: Data on COVID-19 between 31st Dec. 2019 and 8th Mar. 2020 was included. The epidemic trend was analyzed using joinpoint regressions; the growth of affected countries was by descriptive analysis; and the global distribution and transmission trend by spatial analysis.
Findings: The number of new cases in the regions outside of China slowly increased before 24th Feb. and rapidly accelerated after 24th Feb. Compared to China, other affected countries experienced a longer duration of a slow increase at the early stage and rapid growth at the latter stages. The first apparent increase in the number of affected countries occurred from 23rd Jan to 1st Feb, where most of the first confirmed cases originated from China; the second apparent increase started from 25th Feb., where the majority originated from Italy and Iran. The geographic distribution changed from single-center (13th Jan.-20th Feb.) to multi-centers pattern (20th Feb.-14th Mar.). More countries were affected by COVID-19 and developed local transmission.

However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions. This study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community. Methods: We extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53.8% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined. Findings: Of these 50 patients, only three (6.0%) had visited Wuhan while 43 (86.0%) did not have recent travel records. The average interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.5 days. The most common signs and symptoms on admission were cough (74.0%) and fever (58.0%). Radiographic abnormality was found in 46 (92.0%) patients. Three (6.0%) patients required ICU admission. Phylogenetic analysis concurred with epidemiological investigation that 42 (84.0%) cases could be grouped into six transmission clusters. Forty-four (88.0%) cases harboured a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that most (88.0%) cases in Hong Kong were clustered in two subclades with the strains from other countries. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of COVID-2019 outbreak in Hong Kong was December 24, 2019 with an evolutionary rate of 3.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year. The reproduction number value was 1.84 as of February 28, 2020 in Hong Kong. Interpretation: We provided a territory-wide overview of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, which has borders connecting to Mainland China. Transmission in closed settings especially during family and religious gatherings is a hallmark of the recently reported cases. The reproduction number value indicated an ongoing outbreak in the community. Rapid isolation of suspected or confirmed cases and their close contacts coupled with robust laboratory surveillance and social distancing is crucial to the containment of COVID-19 transmission.</jats:p>"

Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly develop acute respiratory distress leading to respiratory failure, with high short-term mortality rates. At present, there is no reliable risk stratification tool for non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. We aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. 
Methods
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from one center in Wuhan city and two centers in Guangzhou city, China were included retrospectively. All patients with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. We compared the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data between severe and non-severe group. Based on baseline data, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for risk prediction in the train cohort. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of nomogram were evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA) were conducted to evaluate the clinical applicability of our nomogram. 
Findings
The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19 and 107 (28.76%) patients had one of the following basic disease, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, tuberculosis disease. We found one demographic and six serological indicators (age, serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width (RDW), blood urea nitrogen, albumin, direct bilirubin) are associated with severe COVID-19. Based on these features, we generated the nomogram, which has remarkably high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing individuals who exacerbated to severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19 (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978]) in the train cohort with a sensitivity of 85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% ; 0.853 [0.790-0.916] in validation cohort with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and specificity of 78.4%. The calibration curve for probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and actual observation. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. 
Interpretation
Our nomogram could help clinicians to early identify patients who will exacerbate to severe COVID-19. And this risk stratification tool will enable better centralized management and early treatment of severe patients, and optimal use of medical resources via patient prioritization and thus significantly reduce mortality rates. The RDW plays an important role in predicting severe COVID-19, implying that the role of RBC in severe disease is underestimated.</jats:p>"

This virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as the cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID19, we determined whether ACE2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. 
Methods: Using RNAseq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6th to 8th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We externally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6th to 12th generation airways. 
Results: In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of COPD compared with non-COPD subjects (COPD=2.52 (0.66) log2 counts per million reads (CPM) versus non-COPD= 1.70 (0.51) CPM , p=.000762). There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=negative 0.24; p=0.035). Current smoking also significantly increased ACE2 expression levels compared with never smokers (never current smokers=2.77 (90.91) CPM versus smokers=1.78 (0.39) CPM, p=0.024). These findings were replicated in the two external cohorts.
Conclusions: ACE2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and with current smoking. These data suggest that these two subgroups are at increased risk of serious COVID19 infection and highlight the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk.</jats:p>"

As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progresses, prognostic markers for early identification of high-risk individuals are an urgent medical need. Italy has the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highest number of deaths, and the highest mortality rate among large countries. Worldwide, a more severe course of COVID-19 is associated with older age, comorbidities, and male sex. Hence, we searched for possible genetic components of the peculiar severity of COVID-19 among Italians, by looking at expression levels and variants in <jats:italic>ACE2</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>TMPRSS2</jats:italic> genes, which are crucial for viral infection.
<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>:
Exome and SNP array data from a large Italian cohort representative of the country's population were used to compare the burden of rare variants and the frequency of polymorphisms with European and East Asian populations.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation.

ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity.

Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by KDM5B.

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients.
Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports.
Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age ≥ 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age ≥ 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L; age &lt; 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age &lt; 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L, 0%) (P &lt;0.001), respectively.

Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. 
Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia.
Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital.

MTB infection (IGRA+ve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe/critical 78% vs mild/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 6.5+/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9+/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 3.4+/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5+/-0.5 days; p=0.075).
Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study. MTB infection status of COVID-19 patients should be checked routinely at hospital admission.</jats:p>"

Methods: In this clinical retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-day mortality, the secondary endpoints were organ dysfunction and septic shock incidence.
Results: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients of 1314 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during hospital stay, of them, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III, and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. As of March 16, 40 (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission, the median hospital stay was 12.0 days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome developed in 58 (69.9%) patients, septic shock in 16 (19.3%) patients. Patients with worse AGI grades had worse clinical variables, higher septic shock incidence and 28-day mortality. Sequential organ failure assessment scores (SOFA) (95% CI, 1.374-2.860; P &lt;0.001), white blood cell (WBC) counts (95% CI, 1.037-1.379; P =0.014), duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) (95% CI, 1.020-1.340; P =0.025) were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. Non-survivors were accompanied by higher incidence of AGI grade III to IV than survivors (17.5% vs. 0.0%, P =0.004).
Conclusions: The AGI incidence was 86.7%, and hospital mortality was 48.2% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. SOFA scores, WBC counts, and duration of MV were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above.

This study described acute kidney injury (AKI) at early stage of COVID-19 and its clinical significance. Three-hundred and fifty-five COVID-19 patients with were recruited and clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Patient's prognosis was tracked and risk factors of AKI was analyzed. Of 355 COVID-19 patients, common, severe and critical ill cases accounted for 63.1%, 16.9% and 20.0%, respectively. On admission, 56 (15.8%) patients were with AKI. Although AKI was more common in critical ill patients with COVID-19, there was no significant association between oxygenation index and renal functional indices among COVID-19 patients with AKI. By multivariate logistic regression, male, older age and comorbidity with diabetes were three important independent risk factors predicting AKI among COVID-19 patients. Among 56 COVID-19 patients with AKI, 33.9% were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Fatality rate was obviously higher among COVID-+19 patients with AKI than those without AKI (RR=7.08, P&lt;0.001). In conclusion, male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes are more susceptible to AKI. AKI at early stage may be a negative prognostic indicator for COVID-19.</jats:p>"

However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them.
Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. 
Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged &gt;60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p&lt;0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>"

Methods.The ChiCTR database was comprehensively searched, and the COVID-19 research registration information as of February 24, 2020 was counted. Descriptive analysis of registration time trends and geographical distribution. Chi-square test was used to compare the statistical differences between different study types, intervention methods, research phases and major sponsors. Frequency studies were used to analyze the characteristics of CMT and BI therapy.
Results.232 COVID-19 studies registered at the ChiCTR Center were collected. The overall number of COVID-19 registrations was increased. Hubei Province, China has the largest number of registrations, followed by Guangdong, Zhejiang and Sichuan. There were significant differences between the number of participants (P=0.000), study duration (P=0.008), study assignment (P=0.000), and blind method (P=0.000) for different study types. Significant differences could be seen in the dimensions of multicenter study(P=0.022), of participants numbe(P=0.000), study duration(P=0.000) and study assignment(P=0.001) for the four intervention methods. There were significant differences in study assignment (P=0.043) between the early and late studies. CMT drugs with high research frequency are chloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and I-IFN, which are all in phase 4; BI was Cell therapy, plasma therapy, Thymosin, and M/P-AB, which are all in early stages.
Conclusion.There were problems of unclear classification of research types and irregular registration behavior. Also, within the studies researched, heterogeneity exists for various dimensions. Different research types, intervention methods, and research stages lead to significant differences in some dimensions of the COVID-19 study. Finally, statistical high-frequency research drugs can provide more treatment options and evidence-based evidence for the clinical practice.</jats:p>"

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by assortative mixing patterns and reactive school closures which decrease mixing between children, or by children exhibiting lower susceptibility to infection, or by children having a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults. We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.</jats:p>"

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus rapidly spreads all over the world and takes thousands of lives in just two months. It is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of COVID-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients in the outbreak. In this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our result shows a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. Notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.</jats:p>"

As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection and disease, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact surveys data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact tracing information from Hunan Province. Daily contacts were reduced 7-9 fold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. Children 0-14 years were 59% (95% CI 7-82%) less susceptible than individuals 65 years and over. A transmission model calibrated against these data indicates that social distancing alone, as implemented in China during the outbreak, is sufficient to control COVID-19. While proactive school closures cannot interrupt transmission on their own, they reduce peak incidence by half and delay the epidemic. These findings can help guide global intervention policies.</jats:p>"

To address the potential impact of excluding physicians with a high risk of adverse outcomes based on age, we evaluated the current patterns of age of licensed physicians across the United States.

Methods: We compiled information from the 2018 database of actively licensed physicians in the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) across the US. Both at a national- and the state-level, we assessed the number and proportion of physicians who would be at an elevated risk due to age over 60 years.

Results: Of the 985,026 licensed physicians in the US, 235857 or 23.9% were aged 25-40 years, 447052 or 45.4% are 40-60 years, 191794 or 19.5% were 60-70 years, and 106121 or 10.8% were 70 years or older. Age was not reported in 4202 or 0.4% of physicians. Overall, 297915 or 30.2% of physicians were 60 years of age or older, 246167 (25.0%) 65 years and older, and 106121 (10.8%) 70 years or older. States in the US reported that a median 5470 licensed physicians (interquartile range [IQR], 2394 to 10108) were 60 years of age or older. Notably, states of North Dakota (n=1180) and Vermont (n = 1215) had the lowest and California (n=50786) and New York (n=31582) the highest number of physicians over the age of 60 years (Figure 1). Across states, the median proportion of physicians aged 60 years and older was 28.9% (IQR, 27.2%, 31.4%), and ranged between 25.9% for Nebraska to 32.6% for New Mexico (Figure 2).

Discussion: Older physicians represent a large proportion of the US physician workforce, particularly in states with the worst COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, their exclusion from patient care will be impractical. Optimizing care practices by limiting direct patient contact of physicians vulnerable to adverse outcomes from COVID-19, potentially by expanding their participation in telehealth may be a strategy to protect them.</jats:p>"

Results:  This study successful enrolled 44 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19, with 21 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 16 to arbidol and 7 to no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of three groups were comparable. The median time of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 8.5 (IQR 3, 13) days in the LPV/r group, 7 (IQR 3, 10.5) days in the arbidol group and 4 (IQR 3, 10.5) days in the control group (P=0.751). The positive-to-negative conversion rates of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid at day 7 and 14 did not show significant differences in the LPV/r group (42.9%, 76.2%), the arbidol group (62.5%, 87.5%) and the control group (71.4%, 71.4%) (all P&gt;0.53).

Methods Individual demographic data, clinical outcomes, laboratory investigations of pregnant women and their newborns were collected from electronic medical records of the Maternal and Children Health Hospital of Hubei Province, during January 24 to February 29, 2020. Anaesthesia and surgery results were compared between pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection.
Results Using CSEA in cesarean section was effective and safe for pregnant women with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infection. Administration of dezocine and morphine was effective as postoperative analgesia, and well tolerated in COVID-19 patients. The assessment of surgery outcomes also showed similar results in both confirmed and suspected cases. No respiratory failure nor distress were found in the mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection and their neonates.

After propensity score matching with demographics, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of parturients with or without COVID−19 were analysed. The anaesthetic regimen and clinical outcomes of themselves and their infants were compared in these two groups of parturients. Results: A total of 1,588 patients without SARS−CoV−2 infection undergoing cesarean delivery were retrospectively included. After achieving a balanced cohort through propensity score matching, 89 patients (COVID−19 group), who were diagnosed with COVID−19 by SARS−CoV−2 nucleic acid test and CT scan matched with 173 patients without COVID−19 (Control group). The SARS−CoV−2 infected parturients in the early stages of COVID−19 outbreak was much more than during the later stage. The main clinical characteristics of parturients with COVID−19 were fever (34.8%), cough (33.7%), an increased plasma CRP (52.8%) and a decreased lymphocyte counting (33.7%). A high rate of emergency and a high incidence of anaesthesia-related complications, such as pharyngalgia, multiple puncture, intraoperative hypotension, nausea, vomiting, vertigo and chills in the COVID−19 parturients. In addition, the parturients with COVID−19 had a long duration of operation and hospital stay, and an increased intraoperative oxytocin utilization and postoperative oxygen therapy. The newborns from the SARS−CoV−2 infected mothers, who received general anaesthesia, had a high risk of Apgar score ≤8 at 1 and 5 minutes after delivery and a higher rate of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Conclusions: Anaesthesia−related complications occur more frequently in the COVID−19 parturients and their newborns have a high risk of distress.</jats:p>"

Objective:  To develop multivariate models to determine clinical characteristics that contribute to false negative results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, and use them to predict false negative results as well as time windows for testing positive. 
Design: Retrospective Cohort Study (Ethics number of Tongji Hospital: No. IRBID: TJ-20200320)
Setting: A database of outpatients in Tongji Hospital (University Hospital) from 15 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.
Patients: 1,324 outpatients with COVID-19
Measurements: Clinical information on CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinic symptoms were collected. A multivariate logistic regression was used to explain and predict false negative testing results of SARS-CoV-2 detection. A multivariate accelerated failure model was used to analyze and predict delayed time windows for testing positive.
Results: Of the 1,324 outpatients who diagnosed of COVID-19, 633 patients tested positive in their first SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (47.8%), with a mean age of 51 years (SD=14.9); the rest, which had a mean age of 47 years (SD=15.4), tested negative in the first test. Ground glass opacity in a CT imaging report was associated with a lower chance of false negatives (aOR, 0.56), and reduced the length of time window for testing positive by 26%. Consolidation was associated with a higher chance of false negatives (aOR, 1.57), and extended the length of time window for testing positive by 44%. In blood routine tests, basophils (aOR, 1.28) and eosinophils (aOR, 1.29) were associated with a higher chance of false negatives, and were found to extend the time window for testing positive by 23% and 41%, respectively. Age and gender also affected the significantly. 
Limitation: Data were generated in a large single-center study.
Conclusion: Testing outcome and positive window of SARS-CoV-2 detection for COVID-19 patients were associated with CT imaging results, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms. Taking into account relevant information in CT imaging reports, blood routine tests, and clinical symptoms helped reduce a false negative testing outcome. The predictive AFT model, what we believe to be one of the first statistical models for predicting time window of SARS-CoV-2 detection, could help clinicians improve the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnosis, and hence,  optimizes the timing of nucleic acid detection and alleviates the shortage of nucleic acid detection kits around the world.

Methods: The clinical data of 33 patients with respiratory symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus in Wenzhou city from January 15 to February 12,2020,were thoroughly reviewed. At the onset of the disease,we found that the primary symptoms were fever,cough,fatigue,chest tightness,chest pain and specific blood test results. According to the patients'histories,the patients were divided into two groups: those who spent time in the main epidemic area and those who did not spend time in the main epidemic area. The differences in the clinical manifestations between these two groups were analyzed.
Results: The main clinical symptoms of patients infected with novel coronavirus in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms. After grouping patients based on the presence or absence of residency in or travel history to the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference between the baseline data of these two groups, and there were no significant differences in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Some patients had abnormally increased serum amyloid protein A (SAA). There were statistically significant differences in the leukocyte count/C-reactive protein,monocyte ratio/C-reactive protein,neutrophil count/C-reactive protein,monocyte count/C-reactive protein and hemoglobin/C-reactive protein values between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05).
Conclusion: Respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms were the primary symptoms of novel coronavirus infection in the secondary epidemic area; these symptoms are not typical. The abnormal increase in serum amyloid protein (SAA) may be used as an auxiliary index for diagnosis and treatment. CRP changes before other blood parameters and thus may be an effective evaluation index for patients with COVID-19 infection.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics in COVID-19 patients remains limited. Here we collected the blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HD) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyze changes in the adaptive immune cell populations and phenotypes. In comparison to HD, the lymphocyte percentage was slightly decreased, the percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lymphocytes are similar, whereas B cell percentage increased in COVID-19 patients. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD-1. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 induced an increased percentage of T follicular helpher (Tfh)- and germinal center B-like (GCB-like) cells in the blood. However, the parameters in COVD-19 patients remained unchanged across various age groups. Therefore, we demonstrated that the T and B cells can be activated normally and exhibit functional features. These data provide a clue that the adaptive immunity in most people could be primed to induce a significant immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection upon receiving standard medical care.</jats:p>"

The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of COVID-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.
Design
The study was an observational, descriptive study.
Setting
This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China.
Participants
12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020.
Primary and secondary outcome measures
The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury.
Results 
While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury.
Conclusions
Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.</jats:p>"

1.1 Background
The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection broke out in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, and has spread to 97 countries and regions around the world. Apart from China, there are currently three other severely affected areas, namely Italy, South Korea, and Iran. This poses a huge threat to China's and even global public health security, challenges scientific research work such as disease surveillance and tracking, clinical treatment, and vaccine development, and it also brings huge uncertainty to the global economy. As of March 11, 2020, the epidemic situation in China is nearing its end, but the epidemic situation abroad is in the outbreak period. Italy has even taken measures to close the city nationwide, with a total of 118,020 cases of infection worldwide.
1.2 Method
This article selects the data of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 at home and abroad as the data sample. Among them: the data of newly confirmed cases abroad is represented by Italy, and the span is from February 13 to March 10. The data of newly confirmed cases at home are divided into two parts: Hubei Province and other provinces except Hubei Province, spanning from January 23 to March 3, and with February 12 as the cutting point, it is divided into two periods, the growth period and the recession period. The rescaled range (R / S) analysis method and the dimensionless fractal Hurst exponent are used to measure the correlation of time series to determine whether the time series conforms to the fractal Brownian motion, that is, a biased random process. Contrast analysis of the meaning of H value in different stages and different overall H values in the same stage.
1.3 Results
Based on R / S analysis and calculated Hurst value of newly confirmed cases in Hubei and non-Hubei provinces, it was found that the H value of Hubei Province in the first stage was 0.574, which is greater than 0.5, indicating that the future time series has a positive correlation and Fractal characteristics; The H value in the second stage is 1.368, which is greater than 1, which indicates that the future epidemic situation is completely preventable and controllable, and the second stage has a downward trend characteristic, which indicates that there is a high probability that the future time series will decline. The H values of the first and second stages of non-Hubei Province are 0.223 and 0.387, respectively, which are both less than 0.5, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the future is likely to return to historical points, and the H value in the second stage is greater than that in the first stage, indicating that the time series of confirmed cases in the second stage is more long-term memory than the time series of confirmed cases in the first stage. The daily absolute number of newly confirmed cases in Italy was converted to the daily growth rate of confirmed cases to eliminate the volatility of the data. The H value was 1.853, which was greater than 1, indicating that the time series of future confirmed cases is similar to the trend of historical changes. The daily rate of change in cases will continue to rise.
1.4 Conclusion
 According to the different interpretation of the H value obtained by the R / S analysis method, hierarchical isolation measures are adopted accordingly. When the H value is greater than 0.5, it indicates that the development of the epidemic situation in the area has more long-term memory, that is, when the number of confirmed cases in the past increases rapidly, the probability of the time series of confirmed cases in the future will continue the historical trend. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate strict anti-epidemic measures in accordance with the actual conditions of various countries, to detect, isolate, and treat early to reduce the base of infectious agents.</jats:p>"

Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 2020. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. 
Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2. After the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the COVID-19 cases started to decline since February 6. There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen.
In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.</jats:p>"

Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources.
Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end.
Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.</jats:p>"

Psychological intervention can be conducted in different ways to improve psychological pain and improve the treatment effect.
Objective:The present study aimed to investigate and analyze the psychological status of patients with COVID-19 during the course of illness, and to evaluate the effect and influencing factors of psychological crisis intervention, so as to explore the effective mode of clinical psychological intervention in acute patients under isolation environment.
Methods:A total of 143 persons participated in the study, including 26 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward (COVID-19 group), 87 patients with general pneumonia in the observation ward (General Pneumonia group) and 30 healthy volunteers (Normal group). All the patients in the ward received comprehensive psychological intervention, including telephone psychological counseling (active and passive), self-adjustment of written materials and one-to-one psychological crisis intervention. Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) and Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) were used to evaluate the mental health status of all patients on the day of admission and 1 week after treatment.
Results:The scores of HAMA and HAMD of all patients (including isolation ward and observation ward) were significantly higher than the healthy volunteers at the time of admission. The total score of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID-19 group were both higher than that General Pneumonia group. After 1 week`s hospitalization with comprehensive psychological intervention, the scores of HAMA and HAMD in CVOID-19 group were significantly decreased.
Conclusion:Patients those who diagnosed with COVID-19 in the isolation ward and/or general pneumonia in observation ward have different degrees of anxiety, depression and sleep problems. While receiving antiviral treatment, patients also need psychological intervention. Comprehensive psychological intervention model has been proved to be effective.</jats:p>"

Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China.

Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification.

Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification.

Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.</jats:p>"

Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. 
Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. 
Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.</jats:p>"

RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population.

Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these RNA transcript standards, full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and RNA-spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, but there are clear differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives with low amounts of virus. Adding to this, many primer-probe sets, including the ""N2"" and ""N3"" sets issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have background amplification with SARS-CoV-2-negative nasopharyngeal swabs, which may lead to inconclusive results. Our findings characterize the limitations of commonly used primer-probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

We aimed to evaluate the correlation of ARBs/ACEIs usage with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in a retrospective, single-center study. 126 COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HPHTCM) in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACEIs group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACEIs group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. 125 age- and sex-matched COVID-19 patients without hypertension were randomly selected as non-hypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 hypertension patients that were admitted to HPHTCM from November 1 to December 31, 2019 before COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, analyzed and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACEIs usage in hypertension patients with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among COVID-19 patients with hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACEIs or non-ARBs/ACEIs had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACEIs group had significantly lower concentrations of CRP (p=0.049) and procalcitonin (PCT, p=0.008). Furthermore, much lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% vs 22.9%; p=0.061), and a lower death rate (4.7% vs 13.3%; p=0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACEIs group than non-ARBs/ACEIs group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACEIs in COVID-19 patients with preexisting hypertension.</jats:p>"

Background The novel coronavirus (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 outbreak started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread over 100 countries. SARS-CoV-2 uses the membrane protein Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was reported that the balance of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACE2, was altered in COVID-19 patients. It is controversial, however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs Angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) shall be continued in the confirmed COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in disease severity between COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included COVID-19 patients used ACEI, ARB, calcium channel blockers (CCB), beta blockers (BB), or thiazide to treat preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any of those drugs.

Methods 
In this multicentre retrospective study, clinical data of 511 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertension comorbidity based on treatment using one of anti-hypertension drugs (ACEI, ARB, CCB, BB, thiazide), or none. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the use of ACEI and ARB associated with pneumonia using published studies.

Findings 
Among the elderly (age&gt;65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19-S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs (OR=0.343, 95% CI 0.128-0.916, p=0.025). The meta-analysis showed that ARB use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of pneumonia. 

Interpretation 
Elderly (age&gt;65) COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity who are taking ARB anti-hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to patients who take no anti-hypertension drugs.

Methods A multi-center cross-section study (285 patients) and a single-center follow-up study (63 patients) were performed to investigate the feature of acute antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. A cohort of 52 COVID-19 suspects and 64 close contacts were enrolled to evaluate the potentiality of the antibody test. 
Results The positive rate for IgG reached 100% around 20 days after symptoms onset. The median day of serocon-version for both lgG and IgM was 13 days after symptoms onset. Seroconversion of IgM occurred at the same time, or earlier, or later than that of IgG. IgG levels in 100% patients (19/19) entered a platform within 6 days after seroconversion. The criteria of IgG seroconversion and ≥ 4-fold increase in the IgG titers in sequential samples together diagnosed 82.9% (34/41) of the patients. Antibody test aided to confirm 4 patients with COVID-19 from 52 suspects who failed to be confirmed by RT-PCR and 7 patients from 148 close contacts with negative RT-PCR.
Conclusion IgM and IgG should be detected simultaneously at the early phase of infection. The serological diagnosis criterion of seroconversion or  ≥ 4-fold increase in the IgG titer is suitable for a majority of COVID-19 patients. Serologic test is helpful for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in suspects and close contacts.</jats:p>"

Background
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated.
Methods
A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed.
Findings
Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was &lt; 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p &lt; 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006).
Interpretation
The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>"

Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. 
Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR.
Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%，68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs.
Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</jats:p>"

Aim: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020.
Methods: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports.
Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent.
Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.</jats:p>"

From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86, 449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days.

Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019-2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.</jats:p>"

Using social media surveillance data, this study aimed to assess public attention, risk perception, emotion, and behavioural response to the COVID-19 outbreak in real time.
Methods
We collected data from most popular social medias: Sina Weibo, Baidu search engine, and Ali e-commerce marketplace, from 1 Dec 2019 to 15 Feb 2020. Weibo post counts and Baidu searches were used to generate indices assessing public attention. Public intention and actual adoption of recommended protection measures or panic buying triggered by rumours and misinformation were measured by Baidu and Ali indices. Qualitative Weibo posts were analysed by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count text analysis programme to assess public emotion responses to epidemiological events, governments' announcements, and control measures. 
Findings 
We identified two missed windows of opportunity for early epidemic control of the COVID-19 outbreak, one in Dec 2019 and the other between 31 Dec and 19 Jan, when public attention was very low despite the emerging outbreak. Delayed release of information ignited negative public emotions. The public responded quickly to government announcements and adopted recommended behaviours according to issued guidelines. We found rumours and misinformation regarding remedies and cures led to panic buying during the outbreak, and timely clarification of rumours effectively reduced irrational behaviour.
Interpretation 
Social media surveillance can enable timely assessments of public reaction to risk communication and epidemic control measures, and the immediate clarification of rumours. This should be fully incorporated into epidemic preparedness and response systems.

Background: Since December 2019, more than 100,000 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have been confirmed globally based on positive viral nucleic acids with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the association between clinical, laboratory and CT characteristics and RT-PCR results is still unclear. We sought to examine this association in detail, especially in recovered patients.

Methods: We analysed data from 52 confirmed patients who had been discharged with COVID-19. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were dynamically recorded and compared with the admission and follow-up RT-PCR results.

Results: In this cohort, 52 admitted COVID-19 patients who had confirmed positive RT-PCR results were discharged after 2 rounds of consecutively negative RT-PCR results. Compared with admission levels, CRP levels (median 4.93 mg/L [IQR: 1.78-10.20]) decreased significantly (p&lt;0.001). and lymphocyte counts (median 1.50×109/L [IQR: 1.11-1.88]) increased obviously after obtaining negative RT-PCR results (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, substantially improved inflammatory exudation was observed on chest CT except for 2 progressed patients. At the two-week follow-up after discharge, 7 patients had re-positive RT-PCR results, including the abovementioned 2 progressed patients. Among the 7 patients, new GGO was demonstrated in 2 patients. There were no significant differences in CPR levels or lymphocyte counts when comparing the negative and re-positive PCT results (all p &gt;0.05).
Conclusion: Heterogeneity between CT features and RT-PCR results was found in COVID-19, especially in some recovered patients with negative RT-PCR results.

Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19.
Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. 
Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs.
Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P&lt;0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P&lt;0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events.
Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>"

Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed.
Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4±15.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15±17.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217).
Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.</jats:p>"

We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved.

The simple methods have the advantage that relations between basic quantities become more transparent, thus shedding light to which quantities have biggest impact on predictions, with the additional conclusion that uncertainties in these quantities carry over to high uncertainty also in predictions.

A simple non-parametric prediction method for future cumulative case fatalities, as well as future cumulative incidence of infections (assuming a given infection fatality risk <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>), is presented. The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude <jats:italic>ρ</jats:italic> will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of epidemic models. This methodology is then reversed, thus enabling estimation of the preventive  magnitude <jats:italic>ρ</jats:italic>, and of the resulting effective reproduction number <jats:italic>R<jats:sub>E</jats:sub></jats:italic>. However, the effects of preventive measures only start affecting case fatalities some 3-4 weeks later, so estimates are only available after this time has elapsed. The methodology is applicable in the early stage of an outbreak, before, say, 10% of the community have been infected. 

Beside giving simple estimation and prediction tools for an ongoing epidemic, another important conclusion lies in the observation that the two quantities <jats:italic>f</jats:italic> (infection fatality risk) and <jats:italic>ρ</jats:italic> (the magnitude of preventive measures) have very big impact on predictions. Further, both of these quantities currently have very high uncertainty: current estimates of <jats:italic>f</jats:italic> lie in the range 0.2% up to 2% ([9], [7]), and the overall effect of several combined preventive measures is clearly very uncertain. 

The two main findings from the paper are hence that, a) any prediction containing <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>, and/or some preventive measures, contain a large amount of uncertainty (which is usually not acknowledged well enough), and b) obtaining more accurate estimates of in particular <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>, should be highly prioritized. Seroprevalence testing of random samples in a community where the epidemic has ended are urgently needed.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, estimating R<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over.  Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same R<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of R<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections.  To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment (R<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections.  Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> when predicting epidemic size.</jats:p>"

We revealed blood cell immune response profiles using 5' mRNA, TCR and BCR V(D)J transcriptome analysis with single-cell resolution. Data from 134,620 PBMCs and 83,387 TCR and 12,601 BCR clones was obtained, and 56 blood cell subtypes and 23 new cell marker genes were identified from 16 participants. The number of specific subtypes of immune cells changed significantly when compared patients with controls. Activation of the interferon-MAPK pathway is the major defense mechanism, but MAPK transcription signaling is inhibited in cured patients. TCR and BCR V(D)J recombination is highly diverse in generating different antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the interferon-MAPK pathway and TCR- and BCR-produced antibodies play important roles in the COVID-19 immune response.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.</jats:p>"

The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP.
Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability.
Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone.
Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.</jats:p>"

Background: A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which have caused more than 80 thousand persons infected globally is still ongoing. This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR).
Methods: The method, termed as converged CFR calculation, was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true T with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated.
Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8% to 0.9%. So far, the CFR had accurately predicted the death numbers more than 3 weeks. CFR in Hubei of China was 5.4% by which the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number for 2 weeks.
Conclusion: The method could be used for CFR calculating while pandemics are still ongoing. Dynamic monitoring of the daily CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller to have a clear vision in the timeliness of the case confirmation.</jats:p>"

Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group.
Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. 
Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p&lt;0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients.
Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.</jats:p>"

It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1°C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.</jats:p>"

Background: To date, large amounts of epidemiological and case study data have been available for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which suggested that the mortality was related to not just respiratory complications. Here, we specifically analyzed kidney functions in COVID-19 patients and their relations to mortality.
Methods: In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we included 193 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Wuhan, 1 hospital in Huangshi (Hubei province, 83 km from Wuhan) and 1 hospital in Chongqing (754 km from Wuhan). Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected, including data regarding to kidney functions. Data were compared among three groups: non-severe COVID-19 patients (128), severe COVID-19 patients (65) and a control group of other pneumonia (28). For the data from computed tomographic (CT) scans, we also included a control group of healthy subjects (110 cases, without abnormalities in the lung and without kidney diseases). The primary outcome was a common presence of kidney dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included a survival analysis of COVID-19 patients in conditions of AKI or comorbid chronic illnesses. 
Findings: We included 193 COVID-19 patients (128 non-severe, 65 severe (including 32 non-survivors), between January 6th and February 21th,2020; the final date of follow-up was March 4th, 2020) and 28 patients of other pneumonia (15 of viral pneumonia, 13 of mycoplasma pneumonia) before the COVID-19 outbreak. On hospital admission, a remarkable fraction of patients had signs of kidney dysfunctions, including 59% with proteinuria, 44% with hematuria, 14% with increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, and 10% with increased levels of serum creatinine, although mild but worse than that in cases with other pneumonia. While these kidney dysfunctions might not be readily diagnosed as AKI at admission, over the progress during hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and diagnosed as AKI. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer were significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients respectively. Importantly, the Cox regression analysis also suggested that COVID-19 patients that developed AKI had a ~5.3-times mortality risk of those without AKI, much higher than that of comorbid chronic illnesses (~1.5 times risk of those without comorbid chronic illnesses).
Interpretation: To prevent fatality in such conditions, we suggested a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the past disease history. In addition, upon day-by-day monitoring, clinicians should consider any potential interventions to protect kidney functions at the early stage of the disease and renal replacement therapies in severely ill patients, particularly for those with strong inflammatory reactions or a cytokine storm.

With the emergence of 4rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered a new period. We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19.
Methods
Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness.
Results 
Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24). 
Conclusions
The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.</jats:p>"

Since then, at least 33 other countries have been affected and there is a possibility of a global outbreak. A tremendous amount of effort has been made to understand its transmission dynamics; however, the temporal and spatial transmission heterogeneity and changing epidemiology have been mostly ignored. The epidemic mechanism of COVID-19 remains largely unclear. Methods: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in China and daily population movement data from Wuhan to other cities were obtained and analyzed. To describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at different spatio-temporal scales, we used a three-stage continuous-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) meta-population model based on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of each stage: 1) local epidemic from December 1, 2019 to January 9, 2020; 2) long-distance spread due to the Spring Festival travel rush from January 10 to 22, 2020; and 3) intra-provincial transmission from January 23, 2020 when travel restrictions were imposed. Together with the basic reproduction number (R_0) for mathematical modelling, we also considered the variation in infectivity and introduced the controlled reproduction number (R_c) by assuming that exposed individuals to be infectious; we then simulated the future spread of COVID across Wuhan and all the provinces in mainland China. In addition, we built a novel source tracing algorithm to infer the initial exposed number of individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020, to estimate the number of infections early during this epidemic. Findings: The spatial patterns of disease spread were heterogeneous. The estimated controlled reproduction number (R_c) in the neighboring provinces of Hubei province were relatively large, and the nationwide reproduction number (except for Hubei) ranged from 0.98 to 2.74 with an average of 1.79 (95% CI 1.77-1.80). Infectivity was significantly greater for exposed than infectious individuals, and exposed individuals were predicted to have become the major source of infection after January 23. For the epidemic process, most provinces reached their epidemic peak before February 10, 2020. It is expected that the maximum number of infections will be approached by the end of March. The final infectious size is estimated to be about 58,000 for Wuhan, 20,800 for the rest of Hubei province, and 17,000 for the other provinces in mainland China. Moreover, the estimated number of the exposed individuals is much greater than the officially reported number of infectious individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020. Interpretation: The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been changing over time and were heterogeneous across regions. There was a substantial underestimation of the number of exposed individuals in Wuhan early in the epidemic, and the Spring Festival travel rush played an important role in enhancing and accelerating the spread of COVID-19. However, China's unprecedented large-scale travel restrictions quickly reduced R_c. The next challenge for the control of COVID-19 will be the second great population movement brought by removing these travel restrictions.</jats:p>"

Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed.
Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10.
Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in severe patients.

We reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 during epidemic ongoing outbreak in Wuhan.
Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records. Characteristics were compared between patients who died or recovered, and between patients with different disease severity.
Results By Feb 25, 2020, 403 patients were enrolled, 100 died and 303 recovered. Most of non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Duration from illness onset to admission was 9 (7-12) days. Patients with severe or critical illness had more days from onset to admission compared to those with ordinary illness. Lymphopenia, anemia, hypoproteinemia, and abnormal serum sodium were presented in 52.6%, 54.6%, 69.8%, and 21.8% cases, respectively. Patients who died or with severe/critical illness showed increased white blood cell and neutrophil count, serum total bilirubin, creatinine, hypersensitive troponin I, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, platelet count, and serum albumin on admission compared to those who recovered or with ordinary illness. Complications of acute organ injury and secondary infection were common in patients with COVID-19, especially in non-survivors.  
Conclusions Multiple homeostasis disturbances were common in patients with severe or critical illness at admission. Early support should be provided, especially for old men with chronic disease, which is vital to control disease progression and reduce mortality of COVID-19 during epidemic ongoing outbreak.</jats:p>"

However, to date, there was hardly any study in characterizing the immune responses, especially adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we collected blood from COVID-19 patients who have recently become virus-free and therefore were discharged, and analyzed their SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell responses. We observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in the patients. Both were detected in newly discharged patients, suggesting both participate in immune-mediated protection to viral infection. However, follow-up patients (2 weeks post discharge) exhibited high titers of IgG antibodies, but with low levels of virus-specific T cells, suggesting that they may enter a quiescent state. Our work has thus provided a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases. It has also implications in designing an effective vaccine to protect and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.</jats:p>"

As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads globally, public health guidance is advising all workers to work from home. However, not all workers are employed in occupations which can be done from home. These workers are at an increased risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2due to increased interaction with the public and other workers, and also potentially at an increased risk for job displacement as more extreme public health measures (such as closing of retail operations or enforcing shelter in place) occur. 
Methods
To characterize the occupations least likely to be able to work from home, national employment and wage data maintained by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with measures from the BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations by a variety of physical, ergonomic, psychosocial, and structural exposures. Noting that the work that could most easily be done at home would be work done on a computer that does not rely on interaction with the public, O*NET measures quantifying the importance of computer use at work, and the importance of working with or performing for the public at work were utilized. 
Results
From this analysis, 19.5% (28.2 M) of the United States workforce covered by O*NET are employed in occupations where working from home would be difficult, due to minimal use of computer at work, and a high level of interaction with the public. These workers tend to be in service occupations, including retail and food service, protective service occupations, and transportation occupations such as bus drivers. About 25% (35.6 M) of the United States workforce covered by O*NET are employed in occupations where working from home could likely be more easily accommodated, as these workers do much of their work on computers and interaction with the public is not important. These workers tend to be in technology, computer, management, administrative, financial, engineering, and some science occupations, which typically have higher pay than occupations which cannot be done at home. 
Conclusions
The workers in occupations that have minimal computer use, and high interaction with the public are least likely to be able to work from home during a public health emergency. These workers could also be at an increased risk for job displacement if public-facing establishments close or alter their business model in the face of increased public health restrictions. Occupations where working from home is not possible tend to have lower annual median incomes than occupations where working from home is possible, increasing the vulnerability of these workers. Characterizing which occupational groups are least likely to be able to work from home can inform public health risk management and prioritize occupational sectors where additional workplace protections are necessary.</jats:p>"

As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach.

At present, viral disease and transmission amongst children is incompletely understood. Specifically, there is concern that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters.
METHODS: We performed an observational study analysing literature published between December 2019 and March 2020 of the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 in children and descriptions of household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2. In these studies the index case of each cluster defined as the individual in the household cluster who first developed symptoms. 
FINDINGS: Drawing on studies from China, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Iran a broad range of clinical symptoms were observed in children. These ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease. Of the 31 household transmission clusters that were identified, 9.7% (3/31) were identified as having a paediatric index case. This is in contrast other zoonotic infections (namely H5N1 influenza virus) where 54% (30/56) of transmission clusters identified children as the index case.
INTERPRETATION: Whilst SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild disease in children, the data available to date suggests that children have not played a substantive role in the intra-household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

Chinese efforts in curbing the virus have widely been recognized. Even the WHO has lauded the efforts of the Chinese government and advised the world to learn from China in fighting the disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, to curb the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has implemented unprecedented prevention interventions at the nationwide level. Currently, the outbreak in Wuhan is changing in a positive direction and has been effectively controlled. However, it is not clear what these measures were and how these measures changed to curb the outbreak of COVID-19 quickly. This study explored the characteristics and identified that China's control strategies have changed the epidemiological curve of rapidly rising new confirmed cases of COVID-19. This study also seeks to expand the experiences and lessons from this outbreak.
Methods: We collected public health interventions measures from Jan 20, 2020, to 5 March 2020, and data from COVID-19 daily newly confirmed cases and daily cumulates cases to compare the control effects and changing trends. We performed a retrospective description of these intervention strategies from three stages. Besides, from the perspective of public health, the experiences and lessons exposed by this outbreak were roughly summarized.
Results: These non-pharmacology interventions measures adopted by the Chinese government by the instruction and spirit of President Xi Jinping were timely and efficient.
Conclusions: The present study was conducted to comprehensively analyze from a social epidemiology context. The results confirmed that these radical interventions taken by the Chinese government were effective, ambitious, and agile. However, we must be aware that the epidemic situation in Wuhan is still challenging.

The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted. With this approach the lack of data due to the still ongoing Italian epidemic was compensated by the Chinese experience, allowing to obtain a SIRD model for this relatively new COVID-19 outbreak. According to the modeling prediction the peak of infection should be on the 28th of March, with almost 42,000 infected people.</jats:p>"

Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to COVID-19-related events in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in China (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list.
Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020 and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST CM6.0 (ROST Content Mining System Version 6.0) was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content.
Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics has changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Finally, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: (1) new COVID-19 epidemics and their impact; (2) frontline reporting of the epidemic and prevention and control measures; (3) expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection; (4) medical services on the frontline of the epidemic; and (5) focus on the global epidemic and the search for suspected cases.
Conclusions: This is the first study of public attention on the COVID-19 epidemic using a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog). Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

Thanks to transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adopt our previously developed CNN, called Decompose, Transfer, and Compose (DeTraC), for the classification of COVID-19 chest X-ray images. DeTraC can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a class decomposition mechanism.

Growth rates peaked in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere with mean temperature of ~5 degrees, and humidity of approx 0.6-1 kPa during the outbreak month, while they decreased in warmer and colder regions.

In the present analysis we coupled climate data with COVID-19 spread rates worldwide, and in a single country (USA).
Methods: Data of confirmed COVID-19 cases was derived from the COVID-19 Global Cases by the CSSE at Johns Hopkins University up to March 19, 2020. We assessed disease spread by two measures: replication rate (RR), the slope of the logarithmic curve of confirmed cases, and the rate of spread (RoS), the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmic curve.
Results: Based on predefined criteria, the mean COVID-19 RR was significantly lower in warm climate countries (0.12±
0.02) compared with cold countries (0.24±
0.01), (P&lt;0.0001). Similarly, RoS was significantly lower in warm climate countries 0.12±
0.02 vs. 0.25±
 0.01 than in cold climate countries (P&lt;0.001). In all countries (independent of climate classification) both RR and RoS displayed a moderate negative correlation with temperature R= -0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P&lt;0.001 and R= -0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.36; P&lt;0.001, respectively. We identified a similar moderate negative correlation with the dew point temperature. Additional climate variables did not display a significant correlation with neither RR nor RoS. Finally, in an ancillary analysis, COVID-19 intra-country model using an inter-state analysis of the USA did not identify yet correlation between climate parameters and RR or RoS as of March, 19, 2020. 
Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a plausible negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID-19 spread rate as defined by RR and RoS worldwide. This initial correlation should be interpreted cautiously and be further validated over time, the pandemic is at different stages in various countries as well as in regions within these countries. As such, some associations may be more affected by local transmission patterns rather than by climate. Importantly, we provide an online surveillance dashboard (https://covid19.net.technion.ac.il/) to further assess the association between climate parameters and outbreak dynamics worldwide as time goes by</jats:p>"

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported.
Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases.
Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%).
Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-γ production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.</jats:p>"

We reported 75 patients with COVID-19 in the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory nasopharyngeal swab samples. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Of the 75 patients with COVID-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to Wuhan. Common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). Of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. Besides, the percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly. We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. Hematological profiles including LYM, LDH, CRP and IL-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Antiviral treatment requires a comprehensive and supportive approach. Further targeted therapy should be determined based on individual clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators.</jats:p>"

According to the high prevalence of new coronavirus, further investigation on the clinical and paraclinical features of this disease seems essential. Hence, we carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to figure out the unknown features.
Methods:  This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers which reported clinical, radiological, and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19. We used STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis.
Results: In the present meta-analysis, 32 papers including 49504 COVID-19 patients were studied. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (84%), cough (65%) and fatigue (42%), respectively. The most common radiological and paraclinical features were bilateral pneumonia (61%), ground-glass opacity (50%), thrombocytopenia (36%) and lymphocytopenia (34%). The study also showed that the frequency of comorbidities and early symptoms was higher in critically severe patients. Moreover, we found the overall mortality rate of three percent.
Conclusion: According to that there are many cases without Computed Tomography Scan findings or clear clinical symptoms, it is recommended to use other confirming methods such RNA sequencing in order to identification of suspicious undiagnosed patients. Moreover, while there is no access to clinical and paraclinical facilities in in public places such as airports and border crossings, it is recommended to consider factors such as fever, cough, sputum and fatigue.</jats:p>"

The disease was caused by SARS-CoV, 17 years apart, also happen in China, and SARS-CoV-2, this epidemic has posed a significant hazard to people health both China and the whole world. 
Objective:  Summarized the latest epidemiological changes, clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination and pathological characteristics of COVID-19. 
Evidence Review:  PubMed database were searched from 2019 to 2020 using the index terms novel coronavirus or COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 and synonyms. Articles that reported clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were included and were retrospectively reviewed for these cases. This paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics.
Results: 34 COVID-19-related articles were eligible for this systematic review;Four of the articles were related to pathology. We found that Fever (86.0%), cough (63.9%) and Malaise/Fatigue (34.7%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19. But in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way. The mortality rates of COVID-19 were 2.5%, and the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 was 3.9%. We also found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as ARDS. But the latest pathological examination of COVID-19 revealed the obvious mucinous secretions in the lungs.
Interpretation: The clinical and pathological characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in China are very similar, but also difference. The latest finds of pathological examination on COVID-19 may upend existing treatment schemes, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker is very important.</jats:p>"

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019.
Results：Of the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. 
Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.</jats:p>"

More detailed and specific characteristics of COVID-19 are needed to better understand this disease. Additionally, durations of COVID-19, e.g., the average time from exposure to recovery, which is of great value in understanding this disease, has not been reported so far.
Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration.
Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. 
Results: Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, the severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration.
Conclusions: COVID-19 has significantly shorter duration of disease and hospital length of stay than SARS. Bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter period of illness onset to admission, lymphopenia, the severity of disease are the risk factors for longer hospitalization duration of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Rationale: COVID-19 have deprived many lives in Wuhan, China and caused global concerns. Few studies focused on clinical characteristics non-survivors hospitalized with COVID-19.  
Objectives: We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of died patients with COVID-19 and tracked the causes of the rapid disease progression and death. 
Methods: 101 non-surviving patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical data were collected and compared between non-survivors who died within 3 days and after 3 days of admission. Multivariable regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors associated with rapid disease progression and death.
Measurements and Main Results: Among included patients, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men. 82 (81.19%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (59 [58.42%]), diabetes (22 [21.78%]) etc. 100 (99.01%) suffered respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) developed acute cardiac injury, acute kidney and liver injury occurred in 23 (22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that elevated high sensitivity troponin I (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.31-5.49, P=0.007), neutrophils (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, P=0.033) and depressed oxygen saturation (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.99, P=0.027) on admission were associated with rapid death of patients with COVID-19.
Conclusions: Older patients (&gt;70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death with COVID-19. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney injury played a crucial role in the death of patients. Elevated high sensitivity troponin, neutrophils and depressed oxygen saturation predicted the rapid death of patients.</jats:p>"

We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases.
Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020.
Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P&lt;0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67).
Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.</jats:p>"

Previous studies have showed clinical characteristics of patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the evidence of person-to-person transmission. Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers.

Methods:
Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. 
 
Findings:
None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Interpretation:
The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.</jats:p>"

Background The pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease, which was occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of February 13, 2020, a total of 59883 cases of COVID-19 in China have been confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. 

Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data.

Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48  years, the average course of the disease was 10.56  days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22  patients (22/25, 88%). Most patients' PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15/16, 93.8%), PCT (11/11, 100%), CRP (11/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14/16, 87.5%). 

Interpretation The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage  was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.</jats:p>"

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been revealed recently. However, the information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making.  
METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%), as well as α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%). A late-onset pattern of lesions in lobules were also noticed. Stratified analysis of the clinical features were not performed due to relatively limited samples.
CONCLUSIONS Our data presented the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients systemically. The findings offer new insight into the early identification and intervention of paediatric patients with COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Although the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19.
Methods
For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. 
Results
We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days.  One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days.
Interpretation
Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.</jats:p>"

Background：Since December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2（SARS-CoV-2）-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019，COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan , China，and rapidly spread throughout China，even throughout the world. We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan area，and explore its effective treatment. 
Methods：Retrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020；The discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients).
Results： Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43（84.3%）patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan，and 4（7.7%） patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4（7.7%） patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])，Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])，all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])，most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P &lt;0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13).
Conclusion：In 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and asthenia，Some patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment.</jats:p>"

We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. 
Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital′s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. 
Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of &gt;5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of &gt;500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (&gt;10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. 
Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.</jats:p>"

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COIVD-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been characterized as a pandemic, which causes a serious public health challenge in the world. A very large group of patients infected by HBV has been reported worldwide, especially in China. In order to answer whether specific treatment strategy on the patients coinfected with HBV and SARS-CoV-2, it requires profound understanding of the clinical characteristics on those patients. However, the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on HBV patients remain largely unknown. 
Approach &amp; Results
In this retrospective investigation, we included 123 COVID-19 patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 5 to March 7, 2020. All enrolled patients are the laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia cases according to the criteria reported previously. A total of 123 patients were analyzed for their Clinical records, laboratory results including the diagnosis of   HBV infection and liver function. Among 123 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 51 years old and 59.3% were females (73/123). Fifteen were previously HBV infected patients, 66.7% of them were males (10/15), patients with HBV infection appeared to have a higher incidence of liver cirrhosis and an increased level of total bilirubin. Seven (46.7%) patients with HBV infection were defined as severe cases, while the severity rate was 24.1% for the patients without HBV infection (26/108). The mortality of patients with HBV infection was 13.3% (2/15) compared to 2.8% (3/108) for the patients without HBV infection. 
Conclusions 
SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause liver function damage in COVID-19 cases and the patients with HBV infection are likely to have more severe disease outcome.</jats:p>"

Background: A new virus broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and was later named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV are still not clear.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China.
Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia.
Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly.
Conclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe pneumonia. Clinicians should focus on these characteristics to identify high-risk patients at an early stage.</jats:p>"

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population.
Methods Retrospective, multi-center case series of the 69 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, from February 7 to February 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 29, 2020.
Results The study population included 69 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. Compared with mild patients (n = 44), severe or critical patients (n = 25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, 58-79] vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; P &lt; 0.01). Fever was present in 98.6% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum (39.1%), and headache (33.3%). The median incubation period was 4 days (IQR, 2 to 7). Leukocyte count was 74.1% of normal controls and lymphocyte count was 45.9% of normal controls. The phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) observed in severe or critical cases in 100%. Levels of lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 were showed significant differences between mild and severe or critical cases. Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy patterns (49.3%), local patchy shadowing (29.0%), and ground glass opacity (21.7%). 7.3% patients were diagnosed ARDS, 7.3% patients were diagnosed acute cardiac injury (troponin I &gt;28 pg/mL) and 4.4% patients were diagnosed fungal infections or shock. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5% patient had died; 1.5% patient had recovery.
Conclusions In this multicenter case series of 69 patients without comorbidities, the full spectrum of asymptomatic, mild, severe, and critical cases is described. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5% patient had died; 1.5% patient had recovery.

Methods A total of 262 COVID-19 patients were discharged from January 23 to February 25, 2020, and were enrolled for analysis of their clinical parameters. The RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to the disease severity during their hospitalization period. The clinical characterization at re-admission to the hospital was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were detected using high-sensitive detection methods. 
Findings Up to March 10, 2020, all of patients were followed up for at least 14 days, and 38/262 of RP patients (14.5%) were present. The RP patients were characterized by being less than 14-years old and having mild and moderate conditions as compared to NRP patients, while no severe patients became RP. Retrospectively, the RP patients displayed fewer symptoms, more sustained remission of CT imaging and earlier RNA negative-conversion but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization period as compared to those NRP patients. When re-admitted to the hospital, these RP patients showed no obvious clinical symptoms or disease progression indicated by normal or improving CT imaging and inflammatory cytokine levels. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and no suspicious clinical symptoms were reported. However, 18/24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested to be positive for virus RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting the carrier status of virus possibly existed in patients recovered from COVID-19. 
Interpretation Our results showed that young and mild COVID-19 patients seem to be RP patients after discharge, who show no obviously clinical symptoms and disease progression upon re-admission. More sensitive RNA detection methods are required to monitor these patients during follow-up. Our findings provide empirical information and evidence for the effective management of COVID-19 patients during their convalescent phase.</jats:p>"

Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. 
Results:  According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO or consolidation. 
The other rare CT symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively. The most prevalent event was Either GGO or consolidation in 85% of patients. 
Conclusion: The most CT-scan abnormality is Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation however in few patients none of them might be observed, so trusting in just CT findings will lead to miss some patients.</jats:p>"

2019-Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreaks create challenges for hospital laboratories because thousands of samples must be evaluated each day. Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections.
Methods: 
We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV.
Findings: 
Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202).
Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed.</jats:p>"

COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during
January 2020 to 16 February 2020.
Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that
accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were
accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all
severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P &lt;
0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The
rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed
tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups
were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range
of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P &lt; 0.01).
Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and
aspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were
elevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of
overall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients
were increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that
in the non-severe group ( P &lt; 0.01 ).
Conclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower
lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for
unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in
severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may
be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.</jats:p>"

Methods and results
Data were collected from patients medical records, and we defined cardiac injury according to cardiac biomarker troponin I level &gt; 0.03&gt;ug/L. Among the 291 patients, 15 (5.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Of 16 hospitalized patients with cardiac injury, the median age was 62 years, and 11/15 (73.3%) were men. Underlying cardiovascular diseases in some patients were hypertension (n=7, 46.6%), coronary heart disease (n=3, 20%) and diabetes (n=3, 20%). The most common symptoms at illness onset in patients with cardiac injury were fever (n=11, 73.3%), cough (n=7, 46.7%), headache or fatigue (n=5, 33.3%) and dyspnoea (n=4, 26.6%). These patients had higher systolic pressures, and lower lymphocyte counts and platelet counts, compared with patients without cardiac injury, respectively. Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and elevated C-reactive protein occurred in all patients with cardiac injury. Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.3%), and receive mechanical ventilation (53.4%), continuous renal replacement therapy (33.3%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (26.7%) and vasopressor therapy (26.7%) and be admitted to the intensive care unit (73.3%).

More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease.

Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19.

Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. 

Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%.

Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19.
Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined.
Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS.
Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. 
Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients.
Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42.9%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient).
Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.</jats:p>"

There is little information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19.

METHODS
In this retrospective analysis from five hospitals, we included pregnant women with Covid-19 from January 1 to February 20, 2020. The primary composite endpoints were admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary endpoints included the clinical severity of Covid-19, neonatal mortality, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of pregnant women and newborns.

RESULTS
Thirty-three pregnant women with Covid-19 and 28 newborns were identified. One (3%) pregnant woman needed the use of mechanical ventilation. No pregnant women admitted to the ICU. There were no moralities among pregnant women or newborns. The percentages of pregnant women with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms were 13 (39.4%),19(57.6%), and 1(3%). One (3.6%) newborn developed ARDS and was admitted to the NICU. The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was 3.6%. 

CONCLUSIONS
This report suggests that pregnant women are not at increased risk for severe illness or mortality with Covid-19 compared with the general population. The SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes that are seen with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection during pregnancy.

Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment.
METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. 
FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread throughout China, but the clinical characteristics of Tibetan patients living in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are unknown. We aimed to investigate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of these patients. We included 67 Tibetan patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of clinical symptoms at admission, with 31 and 36 patients in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, respectively. The epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics were extracted and analysed. No patient had a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients from Wuhan or had travelled to Wuhan. The mean age of Tibetan patients was 39.3 years and 59% of the patients were male. Seven patients presented with fever on admission and lymphocytopenia was present in 20 patients. 47 patients had abnormal chest CTs at admission instead of stating that 20 were unchanged. Lactate dehydrogenase levels were increased in 31 patients. Seven patients progressed to severe COVID-19; however, after treatment, their condition was stable. No patients died. Of the 36 asymptomatic patients, the mean age was younger than the symptomatic group (34.4vs 44.9 years, P=0.02). Lymphocyte count and prealbumin levels were higher in the asymptomatic group than the group with clinical symptoms (1.6 vs 1.3 and 241.8 vs 191.9, respectively; P&lt;0.05).

Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. 
Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. 
Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure.
Conclusions: In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5oC, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease.

The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the clinical, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics of patients presenting with COVID-19. 
Methods: We conducted a structured search using PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to collect both case reports and case series on COVID-19 published up to February 30, 2020. 
Results: Thirty-four articles were included analyzing a total of 99 patients with a mean age of 46.2 years. The most common presenting symptom in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 was fever, reported in up to 83% of patients from 76.4% of the analyzed studies. Other symptoms including rhinorrhea, dizziness, and chills were less frequently reported. Additionally, in studies which reported C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements (44%), a large majority of patients displayed an elevated CRP (73%). Progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was the most common complication of patients testing positive for COVID-19 (33%). CT images displayed ground-glass opacification (GGO) patterns (80%) as well as bilateral lung involvement (71.0%). The most commonly used antiviral treatment modalities included, lopinavir (HIV protease inhibitor), arbidiol hydrochloride (influenza fusion inhibitor), and oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor).
Conclusions: Development of ARDS may play a role in estimating disease progression and mortality risk. Early detection of elevations in serum CRP, combined with a clinical COVID-19 symptom presentation may be used as a surrogate marker for presence and severity of disease.  There is a paucity of data surrounding the efficacy of treatments. There is currently not a well-established gold standard therapy for the treatment of diagnosed COVID-19.

Background In December 2019, human infection with a novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China. The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province.
Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. 
Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU.
Conclusions Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction.

Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with COVID-19 remain unclear.
Objective: To describe the clinical, laboratorial and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19.
Data Sources: The Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and March 30th 2020. 
Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were: (1) studied patients younger than 18 years old; (2) presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (3) contained descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests or radiological examinations.
Data Extraction: Number of cases, gender, age, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, radiological examinations and outcomes.
Results: A total of 34 studies (1,118 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1,111 had their severity classified: 14.3% were asymptomatic, 36.4% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.2% were severe and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (16.3%),  followed by cough (14.4%), nasal symptoms (3.6%), diarrhea (2.7%) and nausea/vomiting (2.5%). One hundred forty-five (12.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (3.8%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count were reported in 13.1% of cases. Abnormalities on computed tomography was reported in 62.7% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground glass opacities, patchy shadows and consolidations.  Only one death was reported.

Background On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared its assessment of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Effective therapeutic drugs are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis of patients, but currently no such drugs are available.
Methods Patients in the study were divided into a heparin and a control group based on whether low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was used. D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage, interleukin-6, and other indices in 42 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia were retrospectively analyzed to compare and evaluate the progress of patients before and after LMWH treatment.
Results Compared to the control group, D-dimer levels in the heparin group significantly increased before treatment, and there was no significant difference after treatment. There was no significant difference in the change of CRP levels between the two groups of patients before and after LMWH treatment, and levels for both groups were significantly lower after, compared to before, treatment. Compared to the control group, patients in the heparin group had a higher percentage of lymphocytes after treatment and lower levels of interleukin-6; these differences were statistically significant.
Conclusions Under conventional antiviral treatment regimens, LMWH can improve hypercoagulability, inhibit IL-6 release, and counteract IL-6 biological activity in patients. LMWH has potential antiviral effects and can help delay or block inflammatory cytokine storms. It can also increase the lymphocytes (LYM%)of patients and has the potential for treatment of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.</jats:p>"

Although several methods were performed in clinical practice, however, the IgM and IgG diagnostic value evaluation was little performed. 57 suspected COVID-19 infection patients were enrolled in our study. 24 patients with positive and 33 patients with negative nucleic acid test. The positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid was 42.10%. The positive detection rate of combination of IgM and IgG for patients with COVID-19 negative and positive nucleic acid test was 72.73% and 87.50%. The results were significantly higher than the nucleic acid or IgM, IgG single detection. hsCRP in the COVID-19 nucleic acid negative group showed significantly higher than the positive groups (P=0.0298).

We show that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Closed environments are consistent with large-scale COVID-19 transmission events such as that of the ski chalet-associated cluster in France and the church- and hospital-associated clusters in South Korea. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.

The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.</jats:p>"

Recent surge of olfactory dysfunction in patients who were referred to ENT clinics and concurrent COVID-19epidemic in Iran motivated us to evaluate anosmic/hyposmic patients to find any relation between these two events.

Methods
This is a cross-sectional study with an online checklist on voluntary cases in all provinces of Iran between the 12th and 17th March, 2020. Cases was defined as self-reported anosmia/hyposmia in responders fewer than 4 weeks later (from start the of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran). Variables consist of clinical presentations, related past medical history, family history of recent respiratory tract infection and hospitalization.

Results
In this study 10069 participants aged 32.5 +/- 8.6 (7-78) years, 71.13% female and 81.68% non-smoker completed online checklist. They reported 10.55% a history of a trip out of home town and 1.1% hospitalization due to respiratory problems recently. From family members 12.17% had a history of severe respiratory disease in recent days and 48.23% had anosmia/hyposmia.
Correlation between the number of olfactory disorder and reported COVID-19 patients in all 31 provinces till 16th March 2020 was highly significant (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.87, p-Value&lt;0.001). The onset of anosmia was sudden in 76.24% and till the time of filling the questionnaire in 60.90% of patients decreased sense of smell was constant.  Also 83.38 of this patients had decreased taste sensation in association with anosmia.

Conclusions
It seems that we have a surge in outbreak of olfactory dysfunction happened in Iran during the COVID-19 epidemic. The exact mechanism of anosmia/hyposmia in COVID-19 patients needs further investigations.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong.

Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected.

Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (&gt;77%) and considered effective (&gt;90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07).

Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.</jats:p>"

Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not been reported yet.
Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was defined as hospitalization, discharged survivor and death, which was followed up until March 12, 2020. 
Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. No significant differences in age and sex were identified between patients with and without diabetes. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease condition with more complications at presentation, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%). Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality of COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders.
Conclusions Diabetes mellitus is associated with greater disease severity and a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Primary and secondary prevention strategies are needed for COVID-19 patients with diabetes.</jats:p>"

Design: Retrospective case studies
Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China
Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020.
Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities.
Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P&lt;0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.

Given the rapid increase in the number of local cases, the availability of accurate, high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing is vital to efforts to manage the current public health crisis. In the course of optimizing SARS-CoV-2 testing performed by the University of Washington Clinical Virology Lab (UW Virology Lab), we tested assays using seven different primer/probe sets and one assay kit. We found that the most sensitive assays were those the used the E-gene primer/probe set described by Corman et al. (Eurosurveillance 25(3), 2020, https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045) and the N2 set described by the CDC (Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.pdf). All assays tested were found to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, with no cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses observed in our analyses regardless of the primer/probe set or kit used.

We aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 and SARS exhibited similar spatial and temporal features at the provincial level in mainland China.
Methods: The number of people infected by COVID-19 and SARS were extracted from daily briefings on newly confirmed cases during the epidemics, as of Mar. 4, 2020 and Aug. 3, 2003, respectively. We depicted the spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 and SARS epidemics using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and the local indicators of spatial association (LISA).
Results: Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher incidence. We identified 3 clusters (predominantly located in south-central China, highest RR=135.08) for COVID-19 and 4 clusters (mainly in Northern China, highest RR=423.51) for SARS. Fewer secondary clusters were identified after the “Wuhan lockdown”. The LISA cluster map detected a significantly high-low (Hubei) and low-high spatial clustering (Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, in Central China) for COVID-19. Two significant high-high (Beijing and Tianjin) and low-high (Hebei) clusters were detected for SARS, although the global Moran's I value was not significant.
Conclusions: The different spatiotemporal clustering patterns between COVID-19 and SARS could point to changes in social and demographic factors, local government containment strategies or differences in transmission mechanisms between these coronaviruses.</jats:p>"

Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy.
Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay.
Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001).
Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.</jats:p>"

But the heterogeneity of outcomes may result in some clinical trials cannot be compared or merged. It is emergency to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials.
Methods: A preliminary list of outcomes were developed after a systematic review of protocols of clinical trials for COVID-19. Then two rounds of Delphi survey was conducted. The stakeholders included traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) experts, Western medicine experts, nurses and the public. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were also invited to participate in a questionnaire with simple language. Frontline clinicians (including TCM and Western medicine clinicians), nurse, methodologist, evidence-based medicine researcher and staff from Chinese Clinical Trials Registry participate in video conference to vote.
Results: 97 eligible study protocols were identified from 160 clinical trials. 76 outcomes were identified from TCM clinical trials, 126 outcomes were identified from Western medicine clinical trials. In the end, 145 were included in the first round of Delphi survey. In the end, a COS was developed for clinical trials of TCM and Western medicine was developed. The COS includes Clinical outcome (recovery/ improvement/ progression/ death), etiology (SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, viral load), inflammatory factor (CRP), vital signs (temperature, respiration), blood and lymphatic system outcomes (lymphocyte, virus antibody), respiratory outcomes (chest imaging, blood oxygen saturation, PaO2/FiO2, arterial blood gas analysis, mechanical ventilation, oxygen intake, pneumonia severity index), clinical efficacy (rate of preventing mild to moderate type patients from progressing to severe type), symptoms (clinical symptom score). The outcomes were recommended according to different types of disease. Outcome measurement instrument/definition were also recommended. 
Conclusion: A COS for COVID-19 may improve consistency of outcome reporting in clinical trials, which may help identify valued interventions after comparing different trials when the researchers report the same outcomes.</jats:p>"

There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning
METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking

RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission.
CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised.

Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries. Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus. Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases. For healthcare systems worldwide it is important to know the expected number of cases that will need treatment. In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change. We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with near-optimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics. We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve. By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity.</jats:p>"

Crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients. Inflammation matters on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided to mild, severe or critical groups. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve.
Results：Significantly, disease severity were associated with age (R=-0.564, P&lt;0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R=-0.534, P&lt;0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R=-0.535, P&lt;0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R=-0.308, P&lt;0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R=-0.422, P&lt;0.001), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (R=-0.322, P&lt;0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R=-0.604, P&lt;0.001), ferroprotein (R=-0.508, P&lt;0.001), procalcitonin (R=-0.650, P&lt;0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R=-0.54, P&lt;0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R=-0.56, P&lt;0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R=-0.585, P&lt;0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R=-0.299, P=0.01).
Conclusion：With following parameters such as age &gt;67.5 years, IL2R &gt;793.5U/mL, CRP &gt;30.7ng/mL, ferroprotein &gt;2252μg/L, WBC&gt;9.5*10^9/L or NC &gt;7.305*10^9/L, the progress of COVID-19 to critical stage should be closely observed and possibly prevented.

Methods: COVID-19 patients transferred from the first emergency ward of Taiyuan fourth people's Hospital from February 8 to March 3, 2020 were selected. The information of general conditions, clinical manifestations, laboratory indexes, nucleic acid detection and treatment were collected. The changes of blood phosphorus level and absolute value of lymphocytes in ordinary and severe/critical patients were recorded and compared. Results: A total of 32 patients with COVID-19 were collected, including 12 cases of common type and 20 cases of severe/critical type. Before treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups were significantly lower than the normal level, and the serum phosphorus levels of the severe/critical patients were lower than those of the common type patients (t = 2.767, P &lt; 0.010). After treatment, the serum phosphorus levels of the two groups reached normal, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (t = 0.231, P &gt; 0.819). The level of lymphocytes in severe/critical patients was lower than that in normal patients (t = 4.636, P &lt; 0.001) before treatment.

Puzzlingly, the impact of the disease is  different in different countries. These differences are attributed to differences in cultural norms, mitigation efforts, and health infrastructure. Here we propose that national differences in COVID-19 impact could be partially explained by the different national policies respect to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination. BCG vaccination has been reported to offer broad protection to respiratory infections. We compared large number of countries BCG vaccination policies with the morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country. The combination of reduced morbidity and mortality makes BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Although these measures were proven to be successful in stopping the outbreak in China, the potential adverse effects of countrywide quarantine have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we performed an online survey to evaluate the psychological effects of quarantine in China using Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale in February 2020 when the outbreak was nearly peaked in China. Along with the anxiety scores, limited personal information such as age, gender, region, education, occupation and specifically, the type and duration of quarantine were collected for analysis. For a total number of 992 valid questionnaires, clinical significance of anxiety symptoms was observed in 9.58% respondents according to clinical diagnostic standards in China. Statistical results showed population with different age, education level, health status and personnel category responded differently. Other characteristics such as gender, marital status, region, and acquaintance with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 did not affect anxiety levels significantly. Respondents experienced different forms of quarantine showed different anxiety levels. Unexpectedly, longer durations of quarantine did not lead to significant increase of anxiety level. Our results suggest a rather mild negative psychological influence caused by the countrywide quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak in China and provided reference for other countries and regions to battle COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity.</jats:p>"

It was first detected in the city of Wuhan in China and has spread globally resulting in substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified the different aspects of this disease. Up to this date, no comprehensive systematic review for the clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic and mortality findings has been published. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis for a better understanding of COVID-19.
Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to March 3, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. Publication bias was assessed and p &lt;0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias.
Results: Out of 1102 studies, 32 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 4789 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5 to 87.6), cough (65.2%, CI 58.6 to 71.2) and myalgia/fatigue (34.7, CI 26.0 to 44.4) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5 %, CI 12.7 to 24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9 %, CI 6.0 to 23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0% (CI 54.3 to 84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0 to 62.4) were the most common findings. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1 to 78.0) was the most common CT-Scan presentation. Pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 9.1, P = 0.01). 
Conclusion: COVID-19 commonly presented with a progressive course of cough and fever with more than half of hospitalized patients showing leukopenia or a high CRP on their laboratory findings.  Mortality associated with COVID19 was higher than that reported in studies in China with Males having a 3-fold higher risk of mortality in COVID19 compared to females.</jats:p>"

Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables.
METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation.
RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P &lt; 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P &lt; 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P &lt; 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P &lt; 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on.

The EnerPol platform has been used in a broad range of case studies in different sectors in all of Europe, USA, Japan, South Korea and sub Saharan Africa over the last 10 years.  In the present study, the entire Swiss population (8.57 million people), including cross-border commuters, and the entire Swiss public and private transport network that is simulated to assess transmission of the COVID-19 virus.  The individual contacts within the population, and possible transmission pathways, are established from a simulation of daily activities that are calibrated with micro-census data.  Various governmental interventions with regards to closures and social distancing are also implemented. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus is based on publicly available statistical data and adapted to Swiss demographics. The predictions estimate that between 22 February and 11 April 2020, there will be 720 deaths from 83300 COVID-19 cases, and 73300 will have recovered; our preliminary variability in these estimates is about 21% over the aforementioned period. In the absence of governmental intervention, 42.7% of the Swiss population would have been infected by 25 April 2020 compared to our prediction of a 1% infection over this time period, saving thousands of lives. It is argued that future scenarios regarding relaxation of the lockdown should be carefully simulated, as by 19 April 2020, there will still remain a substantial number of infected individuals, who could retrigger a second spread of COVID-19. Through the use of a digital tool, such as Enerpol, to evaluate in a data-driven manner the impacts of various policy scenarios, the most effective measures to mitigate a spread of COVID-19 can be devised while we await the deployment of large-scale vaccination for the population globally.  By tailoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of the spread to match the capacity of local healthcare facilities, appropriate logistic needs can be determined, in order not to overwhelm the health care services across the country.</jats:p>"

A new type of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Previous investigations reported patients in Wuhan city often progressed into severe or critical and had a high mortality rate.The clinical characteristics of affected patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less well understood.
Methods
All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings. 
Results
Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom. The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition. As of February 14, 2020, 66(22.1%) patients were discharged and the overall mortality rate remains 0.
Conclusions
In a designated hospital outside the Hubei Province, COVID-19 patients were mainly characterized by mild symptoms and could be effectively manage by properly using the existing hospital system.</jats:p>"

In several European countries including Italy, the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases has followed a consistent, exponential pattern of spread. However, some countries, notably Taiwan and Hong Kong, have achieved a different outcome and have managed to bring the COVID-19 outbreak in their countries rapidly under control, without entering the exponential pattern and with very few cases. They have used several different approaches to COVID-19 outbreak control, including the innovative use of smartphone technology and the widespread use of surgical face masks.
We show through our models, that Canada has followed the same, consistent COVID-19 exponential growth pattern that is seen in Italy. Both nationally and in its most heavily affected provinces, there is exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, making it possible to make predictions for the future, if no further interventions are made in public health policy.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (HWs). We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
METHODS: 
We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety.
RESULTS: 
We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working&gt; 10 years (HR, 2.02; P&lt;0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P&lt;0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P&lt;0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors.
CONCLUSIONS: 
Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological protective measures implemented by the hospital could be helpful.</jats:p>"

An increasing proportion of the women are now infected with this virus during their pregnancy, which may put them in danger in terms of adverse maternal and newborn outcomes. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the possible symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes if the women are infected with COVID-19 during their pregnancy.
Methods: Four databases (Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched on March 25, 2020, using the following keywords: 'COVID-19', 'nCoV-2019', and 'coronavirus'. Articles included if they reported either the symptoms, treatments for the women who have been infected with the COVID-19 during their pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected articles and in the websites of the selected journals. All reported symptoms, treatments, and pregnancy outcomes were summarized through a narrative review of the selected articles' results. 
Results: Total of eight studies selected for this study that comprises 100 infected pregnant women. The common symptoms of infection were fever (65%), cough (38%), fatigue (15%), and breathing difficulties (14%). Usual recommended treatments for general infected people to treat COVID-19 disease such as chloroquine, corticosteroids are not applicable for pregnant women because of potential adverse outcomes. Use of C-section was a common (85.4%) mode of delivery among the COVID-19 infected pregnant women than their counterparts. The occurrence of preterm birth (29.1%), and low birth weight (16.4%), were also among babies of the infected women. 
Conclusions: The COVID-19 infected pregnant women often reported common symptoms of infection: fever, cough, and fatigue with numerous additional symptoms, including myalgia, and sore throat. The proposed treatments for infected pregnant women are different from what usually recommended for the general infected people. The healthcare providers may have appropriately informed about these symptoms and treatments; therefore, they could able to handle infection during pregnancy effectively, which may reduce the occurrence of adverse maternal and newborn consequences.</jats:p>"

The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high). On more detailed analysis, these FSC-high monocytes are CD11b+, CD14+, CD16+, CD68+, CD80+,  CD163+, CD206+ and secrete IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha, consistent with an inflammatory phenotype. Conclusions: The detection and serial monitoring of this subset of inflammatory monocytes using flow cytometry could be of great help in guiding the prognostication and treatment of patients with COVID-19 and merits further evaluation.</jats:p>"

Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) values were used for chest CT findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent severity risk factors. 
RESULTS
In total, 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included, including 20 severe and 64 nonsevere cases. The viral load of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the non-severe group, regardless of the Ct values for N or ORF1ab gene of virus (all p&lt;0.05).Typical CT abnormalities was more likely existing in the severe group than in the nonsevere group in patchy shadows or ground glass opacities, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening (all p&lt;0.05). In addition, the PII values in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the nonsevere group (52.5 [42.5-62.5] vs 20 [5.0-31.6]; p&lt;0.001).  Amongst 84 patients, 13 patients (15.48%) were noted with abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and serum myocardial enzyme levels; whereas 4 (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis. Multivariable logistic regress analysis distinguished three key independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19, including age [OR 2.350; 95% CI (1.206 to 4.580); p=0.012], Ct value [OR 0.158; 95% CI (0.025 to 0.987); p=0.048] and PII [OR 1.912; 95% CI (1.187 to 3.079); p=0.008].
Interpretation
Three key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII, and Ct value. The Ct value is closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and may act as a predictor of clinical severity of COVID-19 in the early stage. SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis should be highlighted despite a relatively low incidence rate (4.8%). The oxygen pressure and blood oxygen saturation should not be neglected as closely linked with the altitude of epidemic regions.</jats:p>"

Sporadic cases have been imported worldwide, in Algeria, the first case reported on February 25, 2020 was imported from Italy, and then the epidemic has spread to other parts of the country very quickly with 139 confirmed cases until March 21, 2020.
Methods: It is crucial to estimate the cases number growth in the early stages of the outbreak, to this end, we have implemented the Alg-COVID-19 Model which allows to predict the incidence and the reproduction number R0 in the coming months in order to help decision makers.  
The Alg-COVIS-19 Model initial equation 1, estimates the cumulative cases at t prediction time using two parameters: the reproduction number R0 and the serial interval SI.
Results: We found R0=2.55 based on actual incidence at the first 25 days, using the serial interval SI= 4,4 and the prediction time t=26. The herd immunity HI estimated is HI=61%. Also, The Covid-19 incidence predicted with the Alg-COVID-19 Model fits closely the actual incidence during the first 26 days of the epidemic in Algeria Fig. 1.A. which allows us to use it.</jats:p>"

The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. Objective: We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics. Primary and Secondary Measures: In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Results. The two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 based on data of March 22nd) compared to a value of R0=2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R0 is decreasing in Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions. Conclusion. The peak is expected by March 29th at national level.</jats:p>"

Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of ≈ 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources. In addition to forecasting the arrival timeline of the state-wise epidemic peaks, we attempt at informing the optimal timing necessary to enforce community-level interventions. Our findings underscore the pressing need for preparedness and timely interventions in states with a large fraction of the vulnerable uninsured and liquid-asset-poverty populations.</jats:p>"

We developed a deterministic, age-structured, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model based on catchment areas of each COVID-19 referral hospitals. We performed one month ahead predictions (up to April 14, 2020) for three different scenarios (R0=1.5, R0=2.25, R0=3), where we estimated the daily number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the needs in ICU beds per Region and the reaching date of ICU capacity limits. At the national level, the total number of infected cases is expected to range from 22,872 in the best case (R0=1.5) to 161,832 in the worst case (R0=3), while the total number of deaths would vary from 1,021 to 11,032, respectively. At the regional level, all ICU capacities may be overrun in the worst scenario. Only seven Regions may lack ICU beds in the mild scenario (R0=2.25) and only one in the best case. In the three scenarios, Corse may be the first Region to see its ICU capacities overrun. The two other Regions, whose capacity will be overrun shortly after are Grand-Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. 
Our analysis shows that, even in the best case scenario, the French healthcare system will very soon be overwhelmed. While drastic social distancing measures may temper our results, a massive reorganization leading to an expansion of French ICU capacities seems to be necessary to manage the coming wave of critically affected COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>"

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.
Methods
Two key factors were analysed which when multiplied together would give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. These factors were case incidence and case morbidity. 
GP Practice data was used as this provided the most geographically granular source of published public population data. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, % age &gt;16 at fulltime work/education, % age over 60, % BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD 2019, Location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as % self-confident in their own long term condition management. 
Average case morbidity was calculated by applying the international mortality Odds Ratio to the local population relevant age and disease prevalences and then summing and dividing by the equivalent national figure. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice.  
Results
The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation with the significance of specific factors moderating over time as the balance between external infection, community transmission and impact of mitigation measures feeds through to the number of cases. It showed that currently Urban, % Working and age &gt;60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence.
The local population comorbidity remains unchanged.  The range of relative HC impact was wide with 80% of practices falling between 20%-250% of the national median.    
Once practice population numbers were included it showed that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England.
Conclusion
Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health and social care resources across the country.  This model provides a method for predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria and thereby providing a method for targeting limited (and perhaps soon to be scarce) care resources to optimise national, regional and local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.</jats:p>"

Bangladesh has confirmed COVID-19 cases and hosts almost 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar with 600,000 concentrated in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site. Projections of the potential COVID-19 infection burden, epidemic speed, and healthcare needs in such settings are critical to inform preparedness planning. 

Methods: To explore the potential impact of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, we used a stochastic disease transmission model with parameters derived from emerging literature. We considered three scenarios with different assumptions about the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the number and daily rate of infections, hospitalizations, deaths, and healthcare needs expected under each scenario. 

Findings: A large-scale outbreak is highly likely after a single introduction of the virus into the camp across scenarios with 65-95% of simulations leading to at least 1,000 infections. Estimated infections range from 119-504 between low and high transmission scenarios in the first 30 days; and between 424,798 and 543,647 in 12 months. Hospitalization needs exceeded the existing hospitalization capacity of 340 beds after 58-139 days between the low and high transmission scenarios. Estimated deaths range from 1,647-2,109 between low and high transmission scenarios. 

Interpretation: A COVID-19 epidemic in a refugee settlement may have profound consequences, requiring unrealistically large increases in healthcare capacity and infrastructure. Detailed and realistic planning for the worst in Kutupalong-Balukhali and all refugee camps worldwide must begin now. Plans should consider novel and radical strategies to reduce infectious contacts and fill health worker gaps while recognizing that refugees may not have access to national health systems. As global resources to fight this pandemic become scarce, displaced persons must not be forgotten.</jats:p>"

Data regarding critical care for patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. We aimed to describe and analyse the clinical course, multi-strategy management, and respiratory support usage for the severe COVID-19 at the provincial level. 
Methods 
Using data from Sichuan Provincial Department of Health and the population-based multicentre cohort study, all microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Sichuan who met the national severe criteria were included from January 16 to March 15, 2020. All patients were followed-up from the day of inclusion, noted as Day one (D1), until discharge, death, or the end of the study. 
Findings
Out of 539 COVID-19 patients, 81 severe cases (15.0%) were identified. The median (IQR) age was 50 (39-65) years, 37% were female, and 53.1% had chronic comorbidities. All severe cases were identified before requiring mechanical ventilation. Among the five predefined criteria for severe illness, low PaO2:FiO2 ratio (&lt;300 mmHg) was the most commonly reported, accounting for 87.7% of the severe diagnosed. By establishing provisional ICUs, all 81 patients were admitted to hospitals capable of providing critical care, among whom 51 (63.0%) were treated in provisional ICUs. On D1, 77 patients (95.1%) were admitted, 76 (93.8%) were administered by respiratory support, including 51 (67.9%) by conventional oxygen therapy (COT). By D28, 53 (65.4%) were discharged, three (3.7%) were deceased, and 25 (30.9%) were still hospitalized. COT, administered to 95.1% of the patients, was the most commonly used respiratory support and met 62.7% of the respiratory support needed, followed by high-flow nasal cannula (19.5%) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (10%). 
Interpretation
The multi-strategy management for severe COVID-19 patients included early identification and timely critical care, including appropriate respiratory support in particular. Preparation of sufficient conventional oxygen equipment should be prioritized.</jats:p>"

Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM &amp; IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

Methods: We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=11) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays.
Results: The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses than typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression.
Conclusion: Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.</jats:p>"

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged.
Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ~4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ~3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ~2.6 based on confirmed cases and ~2 based on the second scenario.
Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.</jats:p>"

However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored.
Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind.
Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection.
Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.</jats:p>"

For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weakly-supervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training.

Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model.
Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%.
Conclusion: The deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist, and greatly improve the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice. It holds great potential to relieve the pressure of frontline radiologists, improve early diagnosis, isolation and treatment, and thus contribute to the control of the epidemic.</jats:p>"

CT acts as an important method of diagnosis. However, human-based interpretation of CT imaging is time consuming. More than that, substantial inter-observer-variation cannot be ignored. We aim at developing a diagnostic tool for artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification of CT images for recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung.
Experimental Design: In this study, images were retrospectively collected and prospectively analyzed using machine learning. CT scan images of the lung that show or do not show COVID-19 were used to train and validate a classification framework based on convolutional neural network. Five conditions including COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and normal lung were evaluated. Training and validation set of images were collected from Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital whereas test set of images were collected from Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University and the fifth Hospital of Wuhan.
Results: Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI framework were reported. For test dataset, accuracies for recognizing normal lung, COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis were 99.4%, 98.8%, 98.5%, 98.3%, and 98.6%, respectively. For the test dataset, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of recognizing COVID-19 were 98.8%, 98.2%, 98.9%, 94.5%, and 99.7%, respectively.
Conclusions: The performance of the proposed AI framework has excellent performance of recognizing COVID-19 and other common infectious diseases of the lung, which also has balanced sensitivity and specificity.</jats:p>"

A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has emerged recently as an acute respiratory syndrome. The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images.   

Materials and Methods
We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19.

Results
The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. The diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on Tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. An online server is available for online diagnoses with CT images by http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/Ncov2019.

Conclusions
The established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 in human samples, thereby allowing identification of patients.</jats:p>"

In Brazil, the first case was reported on February 26. As the number of cases grows in the country, there is a concern that the health system may become overwhelmed, resulting in shortages of hospital beds, intensive care unit beds, and mechanical ventilators. The timing of shortage is likely to vary geographically depending on the observed onset and pace of transmission observed, on the availability of resources, and on the actions implemented. Here we consider the daily number of cases reported in municipalities in Brazil to simulate twelve alternative scenarios of the likely timing of shortage, based on parameters consistently reported for China and Italy, on rates of hospital occupancy for other health conditions observed in Brazil in 2019, and on assumptions of allocation of patients in public and private facilities. Results show that hospital services could start to experience shortages of hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in early April, the most critical situation observed for ICU beds. Increasing the allocation of beds for COVID-19 (in lieu of other conditions) or temporarily placing all resources under the administration of the state delays the anticipated start of shortages by a week. This suggests that solutions adopted by the Brazilian government must aim at expanding the available capacity (e.g., makeshift hospitals), and not simply prioritizing the allocation of available resources to COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.</jats:p>"

Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected  in  a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. 
Methods:
This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value.
Findings:
The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). 
Interpretation:
   Serum SARS-CoV-2  viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to  predict the  poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.</jats:p>"

A cost effective and efficient diagnostic tool as near to the point of care (PoC) as possible would be a game changer in current testing. We tested reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a method which can produce results in under 30 minutes, alongside standard methods in a real-life clinical setting.

Methods: This service improvement project piloted a research RT-LAMP method on nasal and pharyngeal swabs on 21 residents in an NHS Category 1 care home, with two index COVID-19 cases, and compared it to multiplex tandem reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a single RT-LAMP swab compared to RT-PCR, as per STARD guidelines. We also recorded vital signs of patients to correlate clinical and laboratory information. 

Findings: The novel method accurately detected 8/10 PCR positive cases and identified a further 3 positive cases. Eight further cases were negative using both methods. Using repeated RT-PCR as a 'gold standard', the sensitivity and specificity of the novel test were 80% and 73% respectively. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 73% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 83%. We also observed hypothermia to be a significant early clinical sign in a number of COVID-19 patients in this setting.

Interpretation: RT-LAMP testing for SARS-CoV-2 was found to be promising, fast, easy to use and to work equivalently to RT-PCR methods. Definitive studies to evaluate this method in larger cohorts are underway. RT-LAMP has the potential to transform COVID-19 detection, bringing rapid and accurate testing to the point of care. This method could be deployed in mobile testing units in the community, care homes and hospitals to detect disease early and prevent spread.</jats:p>"

Expending our understanding of the transmission routes of the viral infection is crucial in controlling the outbreak. It is unclear whether the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) can directly infect the testes or male genital tract and be sexually transmitted from males.
Methods: From January 31 to March 14, 2020, 12 patients in recovery and one patient died of COVID-19 were included in this descriptive study. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT scans and outcome data were recorded. To examine whether there is sexual transmission from male, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect 2019-nCov in semen or testicular biopsy specimen. 
Findings: The age range of the 12 patients in recovery was 22-38 years. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. As of March 14, 2020, ten patients discharged from the hospital while the rest 2 had developed into recovery stage. All of the patients in recovery tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples. Another died patient was 67 years old, who died in March 10, 2020 and tissue sample via testicular biopsy was tested negative for viral RNA. 
Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the semen or testicular biopsy specimen. The results from this study show no evidence of sexual transmission of 2019-nCov from males.</jats:p>"

Objective: To detect the surface and air contamination by SARS-CoV-2 and study the associated patient-level factors.

Design: Cross-sectional study.

Setting: Airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore. 

Patients: COVID-19 inpatients with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 within 72 hours before the environmental sampling. 

Measurements: Extent of environmental surface contamination in AIIRs of 30 COVID-19 patients by PCR on environmental swabs. The particle size distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the air was measured using NIOSH air samplers. 

Results: 245 surface samples were collected from 30 rooms of COVID-19 patients, and air sampling was conducted in 3 rooms. 56.7% of the rooms had at least one environmental surface contaminated, with 18.5% of the toilet seats and toilet flush button being contaminated. High touch surface contamination was shown in ten (66.7%) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness, and three (20%) beyond the first week of illness (p = 0.010). Air sampling of two COVID-19 patients (both day 5 of symptoms) detected SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive particles of sizes &gt;4 μm and 1-4 μm. In a single subject at day 9 of symptoms, no SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive particles were detected. 

Limitations: Viral culture results were not available to assess the viability of the virus contaminating the air and surface.

Conclusion: Environmental contamination was detected in rooms with COVID-19 patients in early stages of illness, but was significantly less after day 7 of disease. Under AIIR conditions, SARS-CoV-2 respiratory particles can be detected at sizes 1-4 μm and &gt;4 μm in diameter in the air which warrants further studies.</jats:p>"
medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.28.20046094,NA,2020-03-31,Determination of daily reproduction numbers of SARS-CoV2 based on death cases suggests more rapid initial spread in Italy and the United States,"<jats:p>Population density, behaviour and cultural habits strongly influence the spread of pathogens. Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures.
Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death cases by experts in the field.</jats:p>"

The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a near single-copy sensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than RT-PCR.

However, routinely used severity scoring systems are often low on diagnosis, even in non-survivors. Therefore, clinical prediction models for mortality are urgently required. 
Methods: We developed and internally validated a multivariable logistic regression model to predict inpatient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients using data collected retrospectively from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan (299 patients). External validation was conducted using a retrospective cohort from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan (145 patients). Nine variables commonly measured in these acute settings were considered for model development, including age, biomarkers and comorbidities. Backwards stepwise selection and bootstrap resampling were used for model development and internal validation. We assessed discrimination via the C statistic, and calibration using calibration-in-the-large, calibration slopes and plots.
Findings: The final model included age, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase and SpO2 as independent predictors of mortality. Discrimination of the model was excellent in both internal (c=0.89) and external (c=0.98) validation. Internal calibration was excellent (calibration slope=1). External validation showed some over-prediction of risk in low-risk individuals and under-prediction of risk in high-risk individuals prior to recalibration. Recalibration of the intercept and slope led to excellent performance of the model in independent data. 
Interpretation: COVID-19 is a new disease and behaves differently from common critical illnesses. This study provides a new prediction model to identify patients with lethal COVID-19. Its practical reliance on commonly available parameters should improve usage of limited healthcare resources and patient survival rate.</jats:p>"

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis.
METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard.
RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes.  100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method.  In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. 
CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.</jats:p>"

The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG/IgM test kit and RT-PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild/common and severe/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3. Patients were further divided into 0-7, 8-15 and &gt;= 16 groups according to the time from illness onset to sample collection. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in these three groups were 18.8%, 77.8% and 40%; 100%, 50% and 87.5%; 100%, 64.3%, and 93.9, respectively.

However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports. Based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.</jats:p>"

Here we present findings from a proactive longitudinal sampling study of acute viral respiratory infections that documents rates of asymptomatic infection and clinical care seeking for seasonal coronavirus.  We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms.  These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.</jats:p>"

Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities.
In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph.
We use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time is between March 20 and March 30, 2020. This analysis is limited to the analysis of dispersion by airlines, so this estimate should be taken as an overestimate since the infection can arrive by other means.
This model estimates the arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30. This estimation gives a time period to implement and strengthen preventive measures aimed at the general population, as well as to strengthen hospital infrastructure and training of human resources in health.</jats:p>"

One component of PPE that is in particular demand are disposable N95 face masks. To alleviate this, many methods of N95 mask sterilization have been studied and proposed with the hope of being able to safely reuse masks. Two major considerations must be made when re-sterilizing masks: (1) the sterilization method effectively kills pathogens, penetrating into the fibers of the mask, and (2) the method does not degrade the operational integrity of the N95 filters.

We studied Cobalt-60 gamma irradiation as a method of effective sterilization without inducing mask degradation. Significant literature exists supporting the use of gamma radiation as a sterilization method, with viral inactivation of SARS-CoV reported at doses of at most 10 kGy, with other studies supporting 5 kGy for many types of viruses. However, concerns have been raised about the radiation damaging the fiber material within the mask, specifically by causing cross-linking of polymers, leading to cracking and degradation during fitting and/or deployment.

A set of 3M 8210 and 9105 masks were irradiated using MIT's Co-60 irradiator. Three masks of each type received 0 kiloGray (kGy), 10 kGy and 50 kGy of approximately 1.3 MeV gamma radiation from the circular cobalt sources, at a dose rate of 2.2 kGy per hour. 

Following this sterilization procedure, the irradiated masks passed a OSHA Gerson Qualitative Fit Test QLFT 50 (saccharin apparatus) when donned correctly, performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, in a blinded study repeated in triplicate. However, the masks' filtration of 0.3 um particles was significantly degraded, even at 10 kGy. 

These results suggest against gamma, and possibly all ionizing radiation, as a method of disposable N95 sterilization. Even more importantly, they argue against using the qualitative fit test alone to assess mask integrity.</jats:p>"

The ongoing new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia outbreak is spreading in China and has not reached its peak. Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. 
METHODS:
The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number.
FINDINGS:
The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number.
INTERPRETATION:
Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.</jats:p>"

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerges in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, spreads worldwide, and threats the human life. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is important for the prevention of the outbreak and management of patients. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay detected the virus in clinical laboratory.

Methods:
This study utilized primers and single-quencher probes in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. Moreover, we designed the double-quencher probes (YCH assay) according to the oligonucleotide sequence established by NIID. Using these assays, we conducted a one-step real-time RT-PCR with serial DNA positive control to assess the detection sensitivity.

Results:
	The threshold cycle (Ct) value of RT-PCR was relatively low in CDC and YCH assays compared to NIID assay. Serial dilution assay showed that both CDC and YCH assays could detect a low-copy number of DNA positive control. The background fluorescent signal at the baseline was lower in YCH than that of NIID.
Conclusion:
	Double-quencher probes decreased background fluorescent signal and improved detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively. Because live SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in China, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible.

Here we devise a simple model to predict the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The model consists of a set of simple differential equations considering the population size, reported and unreported infections, reported and unreported recoveries and the number of Covid-19-inflicted deaths. For simplification, we assume that Covid-19 survivors are immune (e.g. mutations are not considered) and that the virus can only be passed on by persons with undetected infections. While the latter assumption is a simplification (it is neglected that e.g. hospital staff may be infected by detected patients with symptoms), it was introduced here to keep the model as simple as possible. Moreover, the current version of the model does not account for age-dependent differences in the death rates, but considers higher mortality rates due to temporary shortage of intensive care units. Some of the model parameters have been fitted to the reported cases outside of China1 from January 22 to March 12 of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The other parameters were chosen in a plausible range to the best of our knowledge. We compared infection rates, the total number of people getting infected and the number of deaths in six different scenarios. Social distancing or increased testing can contain or drastically reduce the infections and the predicted number of deaths when compared to a situation without mitigation. We find that mass-testing alone and subsequent isolation of detected cases can be an effective mitigation strategy, alone and in combination with social distancing. However, unless one assumes that the virus can be globally defeated by reducing the number of infected persons to zero, testing must be upheld, albeit at reduced intensity, to prevent subsequent waves of infection. The model suggests that testing strategies can be equally effective as social distancing, though at much lower economical costs. We discuss how our mathematical model may help to devise an optimal mix of mitigation strategies against the Covid-19 pandemic. The website corona-lab.ch provides an interactive simulation tool based on the presented model.</jats:p>"

On 26 March 2020, a total of 17166 cases were already reported, with 2090 deaths.  Globally a R0 index of 2-3 has been reported. We aimed to build an experimental mathematical model that help to analyze the early characteristics of Madrid Covid-19 disese outbreak and to explore the actual R0 index on Madrid Covid-19 outbreak.
Material and Methods: A simulated mathematical model was built, based on a SIR epidemiological model and the reported characteristics of Wuhan Covid-19 disease outbreak. Monte Carlo simulations were further done to estimate the R0 value over time in the Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak. 
Results: Mean estimated R0 value along the early period is of 2.22 (+/- 1.21 SD). A significant increase of 0.093 (+/- 0.037, p=0.025) in R0 value each day of outbreak is found.

Methods: Adult suspected patients aged &gt;18 years within 14 days who underwent chest CT scan and reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to results of RT-PCR tests. The data of basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for confirmed and non-confirmed groups.
Results: A total of 130 patients were enrolled with 54 cases positive and 76 cases negative. The typical CT imaging features of positive group were ground glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally, close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features combined, GGO with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGO with pleural distribution were more common, of which were 31 cases (57.4%) and 30 cases (55.6%) respectively. The combinations were almost presented statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) except for the combination of GGO with consolidation. Most combinations presented relatively low sensitivity but extremely high specificity. The average specificity of these combinations is around 90%. 
Conclusions: The combinations of GGO could be useful in the identification and differential diagnosis of COVID-19, which alerts clinicians to isolate patients for treatment promptly and repeat RT-PCR tests until incubation ends.</jats:p>"

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas.
 
Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas.
 
Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.
 
Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.</jats:p>"

Since the first cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across China, causing multiple introductions in 109 countries/territories/areas as of March 10th. Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources.
Methods: 
We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis.
Results: 
Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283-2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19%
Conclusions: 
We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.</jats:p>"

Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. 
Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P &gt; 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P &lt; 0.05).
Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.</jats:p>"

Limited data exist on how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads in the general population.

METHODS
We used two strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing: targeted testing of high-risk individuals (n=4,551) and a population screening (n=5,502). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 340 individuals.

RESULTS
On March 22 2020, 528 had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the targeted testing (11.6%) and 50 in the population screening (0.9%); approximately 0.2% of the Icelandic population. Large fractions of positives had travelled outside Iceland (38.4% and 34.0%). Fewer under 10 years old were positive than those older: 2.8% vs. 12.3% for targeted testing (P=1.6e-9) and 0.0% vs. 1.0% for population screening (P=0.031). Fewer females were positive in the targeted testing than males (9.5% vs. 14.6%, P=6.8e-9). SARS-CoV-2 came from eight clades, seven A clades and one B clade. The clade composition differed between the testing groups and changed with time. In the early targeted testing, 65.0% of clades were A2a1 and A2a2 derived from Italian and Austrian skiing areas, but in the later targeted testing went down to 30.6% and were overtaken by A1a and A2a, the most common clades in the population screening.

CONCLUSION
SARS-CoV-2 has spread widely in Iceland outside of the high-risk groups. Several strains cause these infections and their relative contribution changed rapidly. Children and females are less vulnerable than adults and males. To contain the pandemic we must increase the scope of the testing.</jats:p>"

Hence, early surveillance and public health emergency disposal are considered crucial to curb this emerging infectious disease. However, studies that investigated the early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China are relatively few. We aimed to compare the strengths and weaknesses of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal for prevention and control between COVID-19 and H7N9 avian influenza, which was commended by the international community, in China.
Methods: A case-comparison study was conducted using a set of six key time nodes to form a reference framework for evaluating early surveillance and public health emergency disposal between H7N9 avian influenza (2013) in Shanghai, China and COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.
Findings: A report to the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China, for the first hospitalized patient was sent after 6 and 20 days for H7N9 avian influenza and COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the pathogen was identified faster in the case of COVID-19 than in the case of H7N9 avian influenza (12 days vs. 31 days). The government response regarding COVID-19 was 10 days later than that regarding avian influenza. The entire process of early surveillance and public health emergency disposal lasted 5 days longer in COVID-19 than in H7N9 avian influenza (46 days vs. 41 days).
Conclusions: The identification of the unknown pathogen improved in China between the outbreaks of avian influenza and COVID-19. The longer emergency disposal period in the case of COVID-19 could be attributed to the government's slower response to the epidemic. Improving public health emergency management could lessen the adverse social effects of emerging infectious diseases and public health crisis in the future.</jats:p>"

The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P&lt;0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone.
Conclusion: Our data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.</jats:p>"

Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation.
Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25° latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios. 
Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0 to 30.1 °C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4 to 23.0 °C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence.
Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

We aimed to assess the effect of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on all cause mortality in patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation.
Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all patients with COVID 19 undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation at Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital Affiliated with Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan from February 12th to March 2nd, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. All patients were followed until death or end of follow up (March 9th), and all survivors were followed for at least one week. 
Findings: Of 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (SD 1.8) years and 30 (83.3%) were men. 22 (61.1%) patients received CRRT (CRRT group) and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed in conventional strategy (non CRRT group). There was no difference in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments and most of the laboratory findings, except for patients in the CRRT group with higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase and serum creatinine. During the average follow-up period of 10.4 days, 12 of 22 (54.5%) patients in CRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in non CRRT group died. Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated a prolonged survival in patients in CRRT group than non CRRT group (P=0.032). The association between CRRT treatment and a reduced risk of mortality remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors in seven different models, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) varying between 0.283 and 0.424. Older age, higher levels of IL1b, IL2 receptor, hs cTnI and NT proBNP were independently associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with CRRT treatment.
Interpretation: CRRT may be beneficial for the treatment of COVID 19 patients with invasive mechanical ventilation. Further prospective multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are required.</jats:p>"

Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of ""daily settlement"" (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, ""daily settlement"" for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies.</jats:p>"
medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843,NA,2020-03-06,Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions for containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"<jats:p>Background:
The COVID-19 outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective. Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World.
Methods: 
We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted.
Results:
We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p&lt;0.001, R2=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020.
Conclusion:
The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.</jats:p>"

ACE2, the receptor for entry into the target cells by SARS-CoV-2, was found to abundantly express in testes, including spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells. However, there is no clinical evidence about whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect male gonadal function so far. In this study, we compared the sex-related hormones between 81 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 100 age-matched healthy men, and found that serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was significantly increased, but the ratio of testosterone (T) to LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to LH were dramatically decreased in males with COVID-19. Besides, multivariable regression analysis indicated that c-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly associated with serum T:LH ratio in COVID-19 patients. This study provides the first direct evidence about the influence of medical condition of COVID-19 on male sex hormones, alerting more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.</jats:p>"

Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^μ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents μ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.</jats:p>"

Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures.
Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty.
Findings In scenario I and II, the isolation-and-quarantine averted 1696 and 1990 humans infected respectively at the cost of US$12 428 and US$58 555, both with negative value of ICERs. The joint strategy of personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine could avert one more case than single isolation-and-quarantine with additional cost of US$ 166 871 and US$180 140 respectively. The effectiveness of isolation-and-quarantine decreased as lowering quarantine probability and increasing delay-time. Especially in scenario II, when the quarantine probability was less than 25%, the number of infections raised sharply; when the quarantine delay-time reached six days, more than a quarter of individuals would be infected in the community. The strategy including community containment could protect more lives and was cost-effective, when the number of imported cases was no less than 65, or the delay-time of quarantine was more than five days, or the quarantine probability was below 25%, based on current assumptions.
Interpretation The isolation-and-quarantine was the most cost-effective intervention. However, personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine was the optimal strategy averting more infectors than single isolation-and-quarantine. Certain restrictions should be considered, such as more initial imported cases, longer quarantine delay-time and lower quarantine probability.</jats:p>"

Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org; additional searches for ongoing trials and unpublished studies were conducted in clinicaltrials.gov and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers.
Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, seven retrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studies included patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The most common treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (n=7). Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30), steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12). No eligible studies examining monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 were identified. One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatment statistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to the virus. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies. Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohort study (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase in the mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin. Eighteen studies reported potential drug-related adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin.
Conclusion: The current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or observational studies, preventing any treatment recommendations from being made. However, it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41/54 studies), which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverse events so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy.</jats:p>"

A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread.
Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). 
Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city.
Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.</jats:p>"

Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a COVID-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. 
Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. Delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. 
Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as measured by R0 is in the lower ranges of reported values. Timeliness as well as completeness of tracing and diagnosis of cases are paramount to achieve containment and effective slowing down of the epidemic growth rate.</jats:p>"

In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. 
Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed.
Results: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.</jats:p>"

As of March 1, 2020, 79,968 patients in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for COVID19 and a mortality rate of 3.6% has been observed amongst Chinese patients. Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56 degree Celsius kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes.

Methods In this study, we collected the daily death number of COVID-19, meteorological and air pollutant data from 20 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Then, the generalized additive model was applied to explore the impact of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on daily mortality of COVID-19. 
Results There were in total 2299 COVID-19 mortality counts in Wuhan. A positive association with COVID-19 mortality was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = −0.32). In addition, each 1 unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 mortality at lag 3.

However, evidence regarding its effects in patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.
Main methods: From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ. 
Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years. No difference in the age and sex distribution between the control group and the HCQ group. But for TTCR, the body temperature recovery time and the cough remission time were significantly shortened in the HCQ treatment group. Besides, a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the HCQ treatment group (80.6%, 25 of 32) compared with the control group (54.8%, 17 of 32). Notably, all 4 patients progressed to severe illness that occurred in the control group. However, there were 2 patients with mild adverse reactions in the HCQ treatment group.

Methods: We reviewed the electrophysiology laboratory records in 3 affected cities: Wenzhou in China, Milan in Italy and London, United Kingdom. We interviewed electrophysiologists in each centre to gather information on the impact of the pandemic on working patterns and on the health of staff members.

Results: There was a striking decline in interventional electrophysiology activity in each of the centres. The decline occurred within a week of the recognition of widespread community transmission of the virus in each region and shows a striking correlation with the national figures for new diagnoses of COVID-19 in each case. During the period of restriction, work-flow dropped to &lt;5% of normal, consisting of emergency cases only. In 2 of 3 centres, electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform emergency work outside electrophysiology. Among the centres studied, only Wenzhou has seen a recovery from the restrictions in activity. Following an intense nationwide program of public health interventions, local transmission of COVID-19 ceased to be detectable after February 18th allowing the electrophysiology service to resume with a strict testing regime for all patients.

Conclusion: Interventional electrophysiology is vulnerable to closure in times of great social difficulty including the COVID-19 pandemic. Intense public health intervention can permit suppression of local disease transmission allowing resumption of some normal activity.</jats:p>"

Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients, their dynamics and association with outcomes have not been characterized.
Methods: 
A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three mild-moderate patients of similar age.
Findings: 
Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG. Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033, resp.). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for IgM antibody was 0.681 (95% CI: 0.517-0.845, P = 0.024). In case-control study paired by age, serum IgM was higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.019), positively correlated with leucocyte count (r = 0.260, P = 0.045), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome and albumin levels (r = -0.337, P = 0.008; r = -0.265, P = 0.041). AUC for IgM levels was 0.704 (95% CI: 0.534-0.873, P = 0.019).
Interpretation:
These results indicate that dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies was similar with that of SARS-CoV, while elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.</jats:p>"

Early in outbreaks, evidence is scarce, but it accumulates rapidly. We are continuously facing new disease outbreaks, including the new coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) in December 2019.The objective of this study was to describe the accumulation of evidence during the 2013-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Pacific and the Americas related to aetiological causal questions about congenital abnormalities and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
Methods: We hypothesised that the temporal sequence would follow a pre-specified order, according to study design. We assessed 1) how long it takes before findings from a specific study design appear, 2) how publication of preprints could reduce the time to publication and 3) how time to publication evolves over time.
Results: We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019. In the 2013-2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports, case series and basic research studies were published first. Case-control and cohort studies appeared between 400-700 days after ZIKV was first detected in the region of the study origin. Delay due to the publication process were lowest at the beginning of the outbreak. Only 4.6% of the publications was available as preprints.
Discussion: The accumulation of evidence over time in new causal problems generally followed a hierarchy. Preprints reduced the delay to initial publication. Our methods can be applied to new emerging infectious diseases.</jats:p>"

Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies.
Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale.
Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping. People may have a cycle of ""the more fear, the more problem-focused coping"". And people may ""The more angry, the more emotion-focused coping"", ""the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness"".   
Conclusion: COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of psychological crisis, and those nurses at the core of the incident are affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and providing timely psychological assistance and training in coping strategies. Improving nurses' ability to regulate emotions and effective coping strategies, providing a strong guarantee for resolutely winning the battle against epidemic prevention and control.</jats:p>"

A large number of healthcare workers (HCWs) were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. 

Objective 
To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China.  

Design
A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Setting 
Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020.  

Participants 
Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (PPE). The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). 

Main Outcomes and Measures
SARS-CoV-2 RNAs

Results
The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated PPE. 

Conclusions and Relevance 
Many surfaces were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. These findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19.  The findings may have important implications for modifying and developing urgently needed policy to better protect healthcare workers during this ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

Herein, we propose a mathematical model to analyzes this epidemic, based on a dynamic mechanism that incorporating the intrinsic impact of hidden la- tent and infectious cases on the entire process of transmission. Meanwhile, this model is validated by data correlation analysis, predicting the recent public data, and back- tracking, as well as sensitivity analysis. The dynamical model reveals the impact of various measures on the key parameters of the epidemic. According to the public data of NHCs from 01/20 to 02/09, we predict the epidemic peak and possible end time for 5 different regions. The epidemic in Beijing and Shanghai, Mainland/Hubei and Hubei/Wuhan, are expected to end before the end of February, and before mid- March respectively. The model indicates that, the outbreak in Wuhan is predicted to be ended in the early April. As a result, more effective policies and more efforts on clinical research are demanded. Moreover, through the backtracking simulation, we infer that the outbreak of the epidemic in Mainland/Hubei, Hubei/Wuhan, and Wuhan can be dated back to the end of December 2019 or the beginning of January 2020.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation.
Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation. 
Results: From Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020, 1916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. The infection rate is estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model. We then estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, assuming the infection risk of evacuees is close to Chinese citizens in Wuhan.
Conclusions: At the beginning of the outbreak, incidence of NCP may be vastly underestimated. Our result emphasizes that 2019-nCov has proposed a huge public health threats in Wuhan. We need to respond more rapidly, take large-scale public health interventions and draconian measures to limiting population mobility and control the epidemic.</jats:p>"

CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%).
Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.</jats:p>"

Background: The clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Hubei and other areas are different. We aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan which is adjacent to Hubei.
Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. 
Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively. Increased fibrinogen was detected in 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients with available results. 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%) patients were positive in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test respectively. Compared with mild or moderate group, severe/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK-MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p&lt;0.01). Most patients received antiviral therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay in discharged patients was 12 days (IQR: 10-15). 
Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hunan is different from patients in Wuhan. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group and moderate group were higher than mild group. Laboratory and imaging examination can assist in the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>"

The features of COVID-19patients withand without pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. 
Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020.
Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (&lt;190/μL) of CD8+ T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
The novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) infected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was broken out in Wuhan and Hubei province for more than a month. It severely threats people's health of thousands in Chin and even other countries. In order to prevent its wide spread, it is necessary to understand the development of the epidemic with precise mathematical language. 
METHODS
   The various data of novel coronavirus pneumonia were collected from the official websites of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. According to epidemic and administrative division, three groups were divided to analyze the data, Hubei Province (including Wuhan), nationwide without Hubei and Henan Province. With classic SIR models, the fitting epidemiological curves of incidence have made, and basic reproduction number (R0) was also calculated as well. Therefore the disease's infection intensity, peak time and the epidemiological end time can be deduced.</jats:p>"

We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing.

Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to ""Disease X"" (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued.

Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%.

Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, that uses only routinely-observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments even before virological test results become available.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, while several key epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified. This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19.
Methods
Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI. To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (&lt; 0.3 day). Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented.
Findings
In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed.
Interpretation
This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.</jats:p>"

However, there is a lack of epidemiological tools to guide effective public policy development. Here we present epidemiological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S type exited Wuhan or other epicenters in China earlier than L type and conferred partial resistance to the virus on infected populations. Analysis of regional disparities in incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemics is a useful surrogate indicator for the undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2. The biggest concern in the world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to regain the living activities of each country. This study provides a useful tool to guide the development of local policies to contain the virus.</jats:p>"

Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China.
Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic.
Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On February 6, 2020, there were 31211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January 23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of 890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to decrease on the twelfth day, from 3156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020.
Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world. Strict measures need to be taken as earlier as possible to prevent its spread.</jats:p>"

As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. 
Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (&lt;= 10 days) and group 2 (&gt;10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. 
Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. 
Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.</jats:p>"

Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Shenzhen and elsewhere in China. The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control.
Methods
The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk.
Findings
Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 21 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days.
Interpretation
Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.</jats:p>"

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NFκB, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic. Epigenetic control of the ACE2 gene might be a target for prevention and therapy in COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Individuals from the country at risk of COVID-19 infection have been included in a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain.
Methods: To estimate the possible number of infected individuals within the large influx of international students, we used a deterministic compartmental model for epidemic and perform a simulation-based search of different rates of compliance with home-quarantine.
Results: Under the home-quarantine program, the total number of the infected individuals would reach 24-53 from March 17-March 20, 50-86 from March 18-March 16, and 234-343 from March 4-March 23 with the arrival of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 1% of pre-infectious individuals, in Seoul, South Korea, respectively. Our findings indicated when incoming international students showed strict compliance with quarantine, epidemics were less likely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. 
Conclusion: To mitigate possible epidemics, additional efforts to improve the compliance of home-quarantine are warranted along with other containment policies.</jats:p>"

It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations.  We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods.

Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program.

medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.09.20033357,NA,2020-03-13,Estimates of the severity of COVID-19 disease,"<jats:p>Background: A range of case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for COVID 19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. 

Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. 

Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. 

Interpretation:  These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.</jats:p>"

Estimating excess 1- year mortality from COVID-19 according to underlying conditions and age in England: a rapid analysis using NHS health records in 3.8 million adults  

Background: The medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. 

Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged ≥30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. 

Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which;  13.7% were age&gt;70 years and 6.3% aged ≤70 years with ≥1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of ≥2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%).  The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age&gt;70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with ≥3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of  80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as  110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. 

Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages.  If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.</jats:p>"

The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China.

Methods
We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity.

Results
We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country.

Conclusions
As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.</jats:p>"

With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks.

Methods:
To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus.  

Results:
Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair).


Conclusions:
The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.</jats:p>"

Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic.
Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 1 March 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. 
Results: As of 1 March 2020, totally 80,369 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 70.9% (95% CI: 66.8%-75.6%) during Jan 20-Feb 2, 20.2% (18.6%-22.1%) during Feb 3-14, 6.9% (6.4%-7.4%) during Feb 15-23, 1.5% (1.4%-1.6%) during Feb 24-March 1 in Hubei province, and 20.3% (17.0%-25.3%) during Jan 20-28, 1.9% (1.8%-2.1%) during Jan 29-Feb 12, 0.9% (0.8%-1.1%) during Feb 13-18, 0.4% (0.4%-0.5%) during Feb 19-March 1 in other areas of China, respectively. 
Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 3 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time.</jats:p>"

The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.</jats:p>"

The quarantine and traffic blockage can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections, henceforth evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine.

Method: We collected confirmed case data and the migration data, and introduced the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor to the Flow-SEIR model. By varying the quarantine factor and traffic blockage factor, we simulated the change of the peak number and arrival time of infections, then the efficacy of these two intervation measures can be analyzed in our simulation. In our study,  the self-protection at home is also included in quarantine.

Results: In the simulated results, the quarantine and traffic blockage are effective for epidemic control. For Hubei province, the current quarantine factor is estimaed to be 0.405, which means around 40.5% of suceptibles who are close contacting with are in quarantine, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimaed to be 0.66, which indicates around 34% of suceptibles who had flowed out from Hubei. For the other provinces outside Hubei, the current quarantine factor is estimated to be 0.285, and the current traffic blockage factor is estimated to be 0.26. With the quarantine and traffic blockage factor increasing, the number of infections decrease dramatically. We also simulated the start dates of quarantine and traffic blockage at four time points, the simulated results show that the early of warning is also effective for epidemic containing. However, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of infections. In general, the quarantine is much more effective than the traffic blockage control. 

Conclusion: Both of quarantine and traffic blockage are effective ways to control the spread of COVID-19. However, the eff  icacy of quarantine is found to be much stronger than that of traffic blockage. Considering traffic blockage may also cause huge losses of economy, we propose to gradually deregulate the traffic blockage, and improve quarantine instead. Also, there might be a large number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19, the quarantine should be continued for a long time until the epidemic is totally under control.</jats:p>"

Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided.
Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin,
China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while
acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.
Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution.

However, given Wuhan's connectivity to other cities in mainland China prior to the lockdown, there has likely been a substantial risk of exportation of cases from other Chinese cities. It is likely that many of these exportations remained undetected because early international case definitions for COVID-19 required a recent travel history from Wuhan. Here, we combine estimates of prevalence in 18 Chinese cities with estimates of flight volume, accounting for the effects of travel bans and the timing of Lunar New Year, to approximate the number of cases exported from cities outside of Wuhan from early December 2019 to late February 2020. We predict that for every one case from Wuhan exported internationally, there were approximately 2.9 cases from large Chinese cities exported internationally that likely remained undetected. Additionally, we predict the number of exported cases in six destinations for which predictions on exported cases have yet to be made, surveillance has likely been low, and where health care systems will likely face issues in managing current or potential outbreaks. We observe heterogeneities in exported case counts across these destinations. The predicted number of cases exported to Egypt and South Africa exceeds the predicted number of cases exported to Mauritania. These trends may anticipate differences in the timing and emergence of local transmission in these countries. Our findings highlight the importance of setting accurate travel history requirements for case definition guidelines in the initial phase of an epidemic, and actively updating these guidelines as the epidemic advances.</jats:p>"

Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do, partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of the risk for death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.4%), 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.6%) in Daegu and 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3-1.4%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate of the risk for death was estimated at 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.7%) in Korea.

It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to develop informed public health strategies. 
Methods:  We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. We. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S. 
Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474).
Conclusion: Our research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the  situation becomes clearer.</jats:p>"

Based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong and estimated the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19.
Methods: Index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19. 
Findings: Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9−6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8−5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong. 
Conclusion: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.</jats:p>"

We perform the non-linear least-squares analysis with data from various countries. The uncertainty for model parameters is computed using the squared root of the corresponding diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We carefully divide countries under consideration into 2 categories based on the estimation of the inflection point: the maturing phase and the growth-dominated phase. We observe that long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries in the maturing phase for both <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>=1 and <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>≠ 1 are close to each other. We find from the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) that the RG-inspired logistic model with <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>≠ 1 is slightly preferable in this category. We also argue that <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> determines the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage. However, in the second category, the estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases contain rather large uncertainty. Therefore, in the growth-dominated phase, we focus on using <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>≠ 1 for countries in this phase. Some of them are in an early stage of an epidemic with an insufficient amount of data leading to a large uncertainty on parameter fits.

As a result of narrow case definitions and limited capacity for testing, the number of unobserved SARS-CoV-2 infections during its initial invasion of the US remains unknown. We developed an approach for estimating the number of unobserved infections based on data that are commonly available shortly after the emergence of a new infectious disease. The logic of our approach is, in essence, that there are bounds on the amount of exponential growth of new infections that can occur during the first few weeks after imported cases start appearing. Applying that logic to data on imported cases and local deaths in the US through March 12, we estimated that 22,876 (95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) infections occurred in the US by this date. By comparing the model's predictions of symptomatic infections to local cases reported over time, we obtained daily estimates of the proportion of symptomatic infections detected by surveillance. This revealed that detection of symptomatic infections decreased throughout February as exponential growth of infections outpaced increases in testing. Between February 21 and March 12, we estimated an increase in detection of symptomatic infections, which was strongly correlated (median: 0.97, 95% PPI: 0.85 - 0.98) with increases in testing. These results suggest that testing was a major limiting factor in assessing the extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during its initial invasion of the US.</jats:p>"

During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction.
	We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days), and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020. 
We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel.
	When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases).
	We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of February 29, 2020.</jats:p>"

During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths.  Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases.  A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19.  We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next.  We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data.  We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed  in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada.  Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).  We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing.  Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq.  Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the ""best case"" outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts.  Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.</jats:p>"

The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across countries and become a global crisis. However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. 

Methods:
We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. 

Findings: 
The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer.

Interpretation:
Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.</jats:p>"

The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province.
Methods  We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019 to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates.
Results  From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%～19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%～96.6%. The average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%～16.6% and the instant cured rate was 83.4%～96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively.
Conclusions The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were underestimated. Wuhan showed higher fatality rate and cure rate than the whole Hubei Province did.</jats:p>"

Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. 
Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu.

Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender.  Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics.
We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]).

Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size.

Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R0 &lt; 1, we would expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks.

The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 is now pandemic. Reliable estimates of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential to guide control efforts and to plan health care system requirements. The objectives of this study are to: 1) simulate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 using publicly available surveillance data; 2) give estimates of SARS-CoV-2 mortality adjusted for bias in the two regions with the world's highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 deaths: Hubei province, China and northern Italy.
Method and Findings. We developed an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model describing the dynamics of transmission and mortality during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our model accounts for two biases; preferential ascertainment of severe cases and delayed mortality (right-censoring). We fitted our transmission model to surveillance data from Hubei province (1 January to 11 February 2020) and northern Italy (8 February to 3 March 2020). Overall mortality among all symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was estimated to be 3.0% (95% credible interval: 2.6-3.4%) in Hubei province and 3.3% (2.0-4.7%) in northern Italy. Mortality increased with age; we estimate that among 80+ year olds, 39.0% (95%CrI: 31.1-48.9%) in Hubei province and 89.0% (95%CrI: 56.2-99.6%) in northern Italy dies or will die. Limitations are that the model requires data recorded by date of onset and that sex-disaggregated mortality was not available.
Conclusions. We developed a mechanistic approach to correct the crude CFR for bias due to right-censoring and preferential ascertainment and provide adjusted estimates of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group. While specific to the situation in Hubei, China and northern Italy during these periods, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions prepare for SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.</jats:p>"

The 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in China. Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic.

Methods
We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19.

Findings
Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility.

Interpretation
COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.</jats:p>"

Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers.
Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days.
Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the Rc to below one in order to end the current epidemic.</jats:p>"

We implement one of the first nationally representative surveys about this unprecedented public health crisis and use it to evaluate the Italian government's public health efforts and citizen responses.

Findings: (1) Public health messaging is being heard. At this point, the Italian people understand how to keep themselves and others safe from the SARS-Cov-2 virus. This is true for all population groups we studied, with the partial exception of slightly lower compliance among young adults. Remarkably, even those who do not trust the government, and those who think the government has been untruthful about the crisis mostly believe the public health message and claim to be acting in accordance. (2) The quarantine is beginning to have serious negative effects on the population's mental health.

Policy Recommendations: Public health messaging is being heard and understood. The focus now should move from explaining that citizens should stay at home to what they can do at home. We need interventions that make staying at home and following public health protocols more desirable, or possibly even fun. These interventions could include virtual social interactions, such as online social reading activities, classes, exercise routines, among others - all designed to reduce the boredom of being socially isolated for long periods of time and to increase the attractiveness of following public health recommendations. Interventions like these will grow in importance as the crisis wears on around the world, and staying inside wears on people.</jats:p>"

Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.</jats:p>"

Methods:  Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. 
Finding:  Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected ≥ 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected ≥ 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples.    
Interpretation:  Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP.

We used reported data from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 23, 2020, fitted the model of infection, and on the number of cases reported to estimate likely number of infections in four high risk metropolitan areas, as well as facilitate understanding the COVID-19's spread pattern. A group of SERI model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and our modeling integrated the effect of the official quarantine regulation and travel restriction of China. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number R0 ​is 3.11 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different level of parameters, For example, In Beijing, the predicated peak number of cases is around 466 at the peak time Feb 29, 2020; however, when the city conducts different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results show that transmission dynamics will change and the peek number of cases shows the changing proportion is between 56%~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risks of COVID-19 spreading and more rigorous control and prevention measures will effectively contain its further spread, but risk increases when businesses and social activities returning back before the ending date. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.</jats:p>"

Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories.

BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. 
METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA).
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG).

medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.27.20043968,NA,2020-03-30,Evaluation of Group Testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA,"<jats:p>During the current COVID-19 pandemic, testing kit and RNA extraction kit availability has become a major limiting factor in the ability to determine patient disease status and accurately quantify prevalence. Current testing strategies rely on individual tests of cases matching restrictive diagnostic criteria to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, limiting testing of asymptomatic and mild cases. Testing these individuals is one effective way to understand and reduce the spread of COVID-19.
    
    Here, we develop a pooled testing strategy to identify these low-risk individuals. Drawing on the well-studied group testing literature, modeling suggests practical changes to testing protocols which can reduce test costs and stretch a limited test kit supply. When most tests are negative, pooling reduces the total number of tests up to four-fold at 2% prevalence and eight-fold at 0.5% prevalence. At current SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, randomized group testing optimized per country could double the number of tested individuals from 1.8M to 3.6M using only 672k more tests.
    
    This strategy is well-suited to supplement testing for asymptomatic and mild cases who would otherwise go untested, and enable them to adopt behavioral changes to slow the spread of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Methods: 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army between January 18 and February 26, 2020, were recruited. Two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits based on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (rN) and spike protein (rS) were used for detecting IgM and IgG antibodies, and their diagnostic feasibility was evaluated. Results: Among the 214 patients, 146 (68.2%) and 150 (70.1%) were successfully diagnosed with the rN-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively; 165 (77.1%) and 159 (74.3%) were successfully diagnosed with the rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs, respectively. The positive rates of the rN-based and rS-based ELISAs for antibody (IgM and/or IgG) detection were 80.4% and 82.2%, respectively. The sensitivity of the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o.

However, with significant numbers of false negatives, improvements to GICA are needed.
Methods: Six recombinant HCoV-19 nucleocapsid and spike proteins were prepared and evaluated. The optimal proteins were employed to develop a sandwich-format GICA strip to detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG) against HCoV-19. GICA performance was assessed with comparison of viral RNA detection.
Results: Recombinant HCoV-19 proteins were obtained, including three prokaryotically expressed rN, rN1, rN2 nucleocapsid proteins, and three eukaryotically expressed rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc spike proteins. The recombinant proteins with the highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) against coronavirus-specific IgM and IgG were chosen for GICA development. The GICA  has a sensitivity and specificity of 86.89% (106/122) and 99.39% (656/660), respectively. Furthermore, 65.63% (21/32) of the clinically confirmed but RT-PCR negative samples were GICA positive.
Conclusions: The eukaryotically-expressed spike proteins (rS1and rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotically expressed nucleocapsid proteins for HCoV-19 serological diagnosis. The GICA sandwich used to detect total antibodies is a powerful complement to the current standard RNA-based tests.</jats:p>"

The anticipated spread of the virus requires an urgent appraisal of the capacity of US healthcare services and the identification of states most vulnerable to exceeding their capacity

Methods: In the American Hospital Association survey for 2018, a database of US community hospitals, we identified total inpatient beds, adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and airborne isolation rooms across all hospitals in each state of continental US. The burden of COVID-19 hospitalizations was estimated based on a median hospitalization duration of 12 days and was evaluated for a 30-day reporting period. 

Results: At 5155 US community hospitals across 48 states in the contiguous US and Washington DC, there were a total of 788,032 inpatient beds, 68,280 adult ICU beds, and 44,222 isolation rooms. The median daily bed occupancy was 62.8% (IQR 58.1%, 66.6%) across states. Nationally, for every 10,000 individuals, there are 24.2 inpatient beds, 2.8 adult ICU beds, and 1.4 isolation beds.  There is a 3-fold variation in the number of inpatient beds available across the US, ranging from 16.4 per 10,000 in Oregon to 47 per 10,000 in South Dakota. There was also a similar 3-fold variation in available or non-occupied beds, ranging from 4.7 per 10,000 in Connecticut through 18.3 per 10,000 in North Dakota. The availability of ICU beds is low nationally, ranging from 1.4 per 10,000 in Nevada to 4.7 per 10000 in Washington DC.
Hospitalizations for COVID-19 in a median 0.2% (IQR 0.2 %, 0.3%) of state population, or 1.4% of state's older adults (1.0%, 1.9%) will require all non-occupied beds. Further, a median 0.6% (0.5%, 0.8%) of state population, or 3.9% (3.1%, 4.6%) of older individuals would require 100% of inpatient beds.

Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to overwhelm the limited number of inpatient and ICU beds for the US population. Hospitals in half of US states would exceed capacity if less than 0.2% of the state population requires hospitalization in any given month.</jats:p>"

Novel Coronavirus infection disease 2019 (NCOVID-19), caused by the corona virus, was first spotted in Wuhan, city of China, December 2019. The NCOVID-19 virus is spread among individuals through close communication in the form of droplets, not via airborne. Those individuals are at risk of infection who are in close contact with a NCOVID-19 patient or who take care of NCOVID-19 patients. Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of any infection in healthcare facilities. Therefore, healthcare workers should be aware of basic knowledge and all procedures concerning prevention and protection from NCOVID-19. 
Objective
The objective of this study was to evaluate the awareness level of healthcare workers toward NCOVID-2019 in Pakistan. 
Material and Methods
A questionnaire was generated according to WHO information that was circulated among the healthcare workers of different hospitals and medical institutes of Pakistan. Calculated sample size was 650.

Background
The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019 (COVID-19) has activated top-level response nationwide. We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients.
Methods
In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. 
Findings
The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(≥8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P&lt;0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients.
Interpretation
Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff.</jats:p>"

While China - were the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second-order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases</jats:p>"

Elucidating the diagnostic value of different methods, especially the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies assays for SARS-CoV-2 infection is helpful for improving the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, providing timely treatment, and differentiating the infected cases from the healthy, thus preventing further epidemics.
Methods: Medical records from 38 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Second People's Hospital of Fuyang from January 22, 2020 to February 28, 2020 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Specimens including throat swabs, sputum and serum were collected during the hospitalization period, viral RNAs and serum IgM-IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured respectively. The detectability of different methods as well as the auxiliary diagnosis value of antibodies test for SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed.  
Results: Among 38 patients, the total seropositive rate for IgM and IgG was 50.0% and 92.1%, respectively. Two patients remained seronegative throughout the course of illness. In the early phase of illness, the RNA test for sputum specimens possessed the highest detectability(92.3%), followed by the the RNA test for throat swabs (69.2%), and the antibodies assays presented lower positive rates(IgM, 23.0%, IgG, 53.8%). While, the sensitivity of antibodies assays overtook that of RNA test since day 8 after onset (IgM, 50.0%; IgG, 87.5%). Of note, the positive rate of throat swabs was only 13.0% for cases in later phase(≥15 d.a.o), and the sensitivities of IgM and IgG rose to 52.2% and 91.3%, respectively. Combined use of antibodies assay and qRT-PCR at the same time was able to improve the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis, especially for the throat swabs group at the later stage of illness. Moreover, most of these cases with undetectable viral RNA in throat swabs specimens at the early stage of illness were able to be IgM/IgG seropositive after 7 days.
Conclusions: The antibodies detection against SARS-CoV-2 offers vital clinical information for physicians, and could be used as an effective supplementary indicator for suspected cases of negative viral nucleic acid detection or in conjunction with nucleic acid detection in the diagnosis of suspected cases.</jats:p>"

A sensitive and accurate diagnosis method will substantially help to control disease expansion. Here, we developed a chemiluminescence-immunoassay method based on the recombinant nucleocapsid antigen and the magnetic beads for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and surveillance of antibody changing pattern. Serums from 29 healthy individuals, 51 tuberculosis patients, and 79 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients were employed to evaluate the performance of this approach. Compared to the IgM testing, the IgG testing was more reliable in which it identified 65 SARS-CoV-2 infections from the 79 confirmed patients and only two false-positive cases from the 80 control group with a sensitivity and specificity reaching 82.28% and 97.5%, respectively.  However, only a slight difference (not statistically significant) in the detected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections was observed between the IgM and IgG testing manner in patients at a different time of onset of disease.  A performance comparison between an ELISA kit using the same nucleocapsid antigen and our chemiluminescence method was undertaken. The same false-positive cases were seen in both methods from the paired control group, while ELISA kit can only detect half of the SARS-CoV-2 infections from paired SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients group than that of the chemiluminescence method, indicating a higher performance for the chemiluminescence-immunoassay approach.

A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview.
Results:
A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan.
Conclusions:
We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.</jats:p>"

While it's evident that the virus invades respiratory tract and transmits from human to human through airway, other viral tropisms and transmission routes remain unknown. We tested viral RNA in stool from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients using rRT-PCR. 53.42% of the patients tested positive in stool. 23.29% of the patients remained positive in feces even after the viral RNA decreased to undetectable level in respiratory tract. The viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia showed positive immunofluorescent staining of viral host receptor ACE2 and viral nucleocapsid protein in a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential fecal-oral transmission route.</jats:p>"

We described the epidemiological features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak, and evaluated the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in Wuhan, China.

METHODS
Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. 

RESULTS
The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age &lt;20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18. We found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases.

CONCLUSIONS	
Considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Special efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, elderly and children. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.</jats:p>"

The COVID-19 epidemic originated in Wuhan City of Hubei Province in December 2019 and has spread throughout China. Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. 
Methods
We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. 
Results  
The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. 
Conclusion  
Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.</jats:p>"

In January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Interest (PHEI). Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a COVID-19 epidemic in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We used a generalized SEIR (Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, with additional Hospitalized
variables (SEIHR model) and age-stratified structure to analyze the expected time evolution during the onset of the epidemic in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. The model allows to determine the evolution of the number of cases, the number of patients admitted to hospitals and deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to investigate the sensibility of our results with respect to parameter estimation errors we performed Monte Carlo analysis with 100 000 simulations by sampling parameter values from an uniform distribution in the confidence interval. Results: We estimate 1 368 (IQR: 880, 2 407) cases, 301 (22%) in older people (more than 60 years), 81 (50, 143) hospitalizations, and 14 (9, 26) deaths in the first 30 days, and 38 583 (IQR: 16 698, 113, 163) cases, 8 427 (21.8%) in older people (more than 60 years), 2181 (914, 6392) hospitalizations, and 397(166, 1205) deaths in the first 60 days. Limitations: We supposed a constant transmission probability Pc among different age-groups, and that every severe and critic case will be hospitalized, as well as that the detection capacity in all the primary healthcare services does not change during the outbreak. Conclusion: Supposing the reported parameters in the literature apply in the city of Sao Paulo, our study shows that it is expected that the impact of a COVID-19 outbreak will be important, requiring special planning from the authorities. This is the first study for a major metropolitan center in the south hemisphere, and we believe it can provide policymakers with a prognosis of the burden of the pandemic not only in Brazil, but also in other
tropical zones, allowing to estimate total cases, hospitalization, and deaths, in support to the
management of the public health emergence caused by COVID-19.</jats:p>"

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p&lt;0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis. In conclusion, the current MR analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ACE2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. The proteome-wide MR analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. Nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses.</jats:p>"
medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.22.20041111,NA,2020-03-27,Exponential damping key to successful containment of COVID-19 outbreak,"<jats:p>Due to the excessively high capability of human-to-human transmission, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first reported in Wuhan of China, has rapidly spread to the entire nation and beyond, and has now been declared a global public health emergency. Understanding the transmission pattern of the virus and the effect of control measures on the transmission, is crucial to improving the national and international disease control effectiveness. We here propose a simple model based on the exponential infectious growth but with a time-varying, largely damping, transmission rate. This model provides an excellent fit to the existing data and, we think, has largely captured the transmission pattern of the COVID-19 outbreak under a variety of intervention and control measures. Successful control measures, such as in China and South Korea, have resulted in an exponentially damping dynamics of the viral spread. Such exponential damping, therefore, could be used as a measure of control effectiveness, as also shown in the data of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Our model suggests that the COVID-19 outbreak is currently accelerating worldwide with the exponential damping yet to emerge. Consistent with the message from the World Health Organisation (WHO), we thus strongly suggest all countries to take active measures to contain this global pandemic.</jats:p>"

Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. 
Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item.  
Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times.
Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.</jats:p>"

Our previous study has shown that cytokine storm occurred during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the detailed role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the limited case number. In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome.

We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.</jats:p>"

However, studies about risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the potential impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment remain scarce.
Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had RT-PCR conversion at the NO.3 People's hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding.
Results: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (IQR, 18-32 days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The median duration of viral shedding was shorter in the LPV/r treatment group (n=78) than that in no LPV/r treatment group (n=42) (median, 22 days vs. 28.5 days, p=0.02). Only earlier administration of LPV/r treatment (≤10 days from symptom onset) could shorten the duration of viral shedding. 
Conclusions: Older age and lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding.</jats:p>"

Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and arbidol to treat COVID-19 patients on clinical recovery rate of day 7.
Design: Prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized superiority trial in February, 2020.
Setting: Multicenter study.
Participants: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 3 hospitals from Feb. 20, 2020 to Mar. 12, 2020.
Interventions: Conventional therapy + favipiravir or arbidol.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was clinical recovery rate of day 7. Duration of fever, cough relief time and auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate were the secondary outcomes. The patients with chest CT imaging and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection, aged 18 years or older were randomly assigned to receive favipiravir or arbidol. Safety data were collected for further follow-up for a week. 
Results: 120 patients were assigned to favipiravir group (116 assessed) and 120 to arbidol group (120 assessed). In full analysis set (FAS) cohort, for moderate patients with COVID-19, clinical recovery rate of day 7 was 55.86% in the arbidol group and 71.43% in the favipiravir group (P=0.0199). For moderate COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 patients with hypertension and/or diabetes, the latency to fever reduction and cough relief in favipiravir group was significantly shorter than that in arbidol group (both P&lt;0.001), but there was no statistical difference was observed of auxiliary oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rate (both P&gt;0.05). The most frequently observed treatment-associated adverse events were abnormal LFT, psychiatric symptom reactions, digestive tract reactions and raised serum uric acid (3 [2.50%] in arbidol group vs 16 [13.79%] in favipiravir group, P&lt;0.0001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In moderate COVID-19 patients untreated with antiviral previously, favipiravir can be considered as a preferred treatment compared to arbidol because of superior clinical recovery rate of day 7 and more effectively reduced incidence of fever, cough besides some manageable antiviral-associated adverse effects.

medRxiv,10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162,NA,2020-02-11,Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts,"<jats:p>Background: To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV.

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. 

Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.

Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.</jats:p>"

For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, most countries take two typical intervention strategies: suppression approach like immediately lock-downing cities at epicentre of and mitigation; or mitigation approach that slows down but not stopping epidemic of COVID-19 for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention strategy as the most feasible way to certain country. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducts a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that access the effectiveness of mitigation, suppression and hybrid interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. The model first extends traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model by considering one key fact: there is a direct link between Exposed and Recovered population. Then, it defines threshold and parameters to classify two stages of COVID control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan, London, Hubei province and the UK during January, 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results show that 1) Suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduces total exposed and infectious populations, but it has to be consistently maintained at least a period of 90 days (by the middle of April 2020) where its success relies on sufficient support from other parts of China. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period. While the total infectious populations will be doubled, the economic performance of London will be less affected due to limited mobility constraints. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data is that there are a large portion (like 42.5% in Wuhan) of self-recovered population who are asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home because they did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity might increase a risk of the second breakout. One limitation of our model is that its prediction of infections and deaths depends on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. We assume that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number in different regions over time. The practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county.</jats:p>"

Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. 
Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients.
Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long. Hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset.</jats:p>"

We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""clintrialgov"" xlink:href=""NCT04291729"">NCT04291729</jats:ext-link>) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day). Our findings suggest that repurposing danoprevir for COVID-19 is a promising therapeutic option.</jats:p>"

Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service.

Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions.
 
Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months. 

Conclusions: Once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.</jats:p>"

An explainer using a simple model","<jats:p>Background: Around the world there are examples of both very good and effective control (e.g., South Korea, Japan) and slower, less aggressive control (e.g., Italy, Spain, United States) of COVID-19 with dramatic differences in the consequent epidemic curves. Models agree that flattening the curve without controlling the epidemic completely is insufficient and will lead to an overwhelmed health service. A recent model, calibrated for the UK and US, demonstrated this starkly. 
Methods: We used a simple compartmental deterministic model of COVID-19 transmission in Australia, to illustrate the dynamics resulting from shifting or flattening the curve versus completely squashing it.
Results: We find that when the reproduction number is close to one, a small decrease in transmission leads to a large reduction in burden (i.e., cases, deaths and hospitalisations) but achieving this early in the epidemic through social distancing interventions also implies that the community will not reach herd immunity. 
Conclusions: Australia needs not just to shift and flatten the curve but to squash it by getting the reproduction number below one. This will require Australia to achieve for transmission rates at least two thirds lower than those seen in the most severely affected countries.</jats:p>"

Question: Assuming social distancing measures are maintained, what are the forecasted gaps in available health service resources and number of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic for each state in the United States?   
Findings: Using a statistical model, we predict excess demand will be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds at the peak of COVID-19. Peak ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674) ventilators. Peak demand will be in the second week of April. We estimate 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths in the United States from COVID-19 over the next 4 months.  
Meaning: Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially. Alongside the implementation and enforcement of social distancing measures, there is an urgent need to develop and implement plans to reduce non-COVID-19 demand for and temporarily increase capacity of health facilities.   

Abstract 
Importance: This study presents the first set of estimates of predicted health service utilization and deaths due to COVID-19 by day for the next 4 months for each state in the US.  
Objective: To determine the extent and timing of deaths and excess demand for hospital services due to COVID-19 in the US.  
Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used data on confirmed COVID-19  deaths by day from WHO websites and local and national governments; data on hospital capacity and utilization for US states; and observed COVID-19 utilization data from select locations to develop a statistical model forecasting deaths and hospital utilization against capacity by state for the US over the next 4 months. 
Exposure(s): COVID-19. 
Main outcome(s) and measure(s): Deaths, bed and ICU occupancy, and ventilator use. 
Results: Compared to licensed capacity and average annual occupancy rates, excess demand from COVID-19 at the peak of the pandemic in the second week of April is predicted to be 64,175 (95% UI 7,977 to 251,059) total beds and 17,380 (95% UI 2,432 to 57,955) ICU beds. At the peak of the pandemic, ventilator use is predicted to be 19,481 (95% UI 9,767 to 39,674). The date of peak excess demand by state varies from the second week of April through May. We estimate that there will a total of 81,114 (95% UI 38,242 to 162,106) deaths from COVID-19 over the next 4 months in the US. Deaths from COVID-19 are estimated to drop below 10 deaths per day between May 31 and June 6.    
Conclusions and Relevance: In addition to a large number of deaths from COVID-19, the epidemic in the US will place a load well beyond the current capacity of hospitals to manage, especially for ICU care. These estimates can help inform the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate this gap, including reducing non-COVID-19 demand for services and temporarily increasing system capacity. These are urgently needed given that peak volumes are estimated to be only three weeks away. The estimated excess demand on hospital systems is predicated on the enactment of social distancing measures in all states that have not done so already within the next week and maintenance of these measures throughout the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of implementing, enforcing, and maintaining these measures to mitigate hospital system overload and prevent deaths.</jats:p>"

Italy, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Spain, the U.S. and Japan are probable the most severe countries. Collecting epidemiological data and predicting epidemic trends are important to develop and measure public intervention strategies. Epidemic predictions results yield by different mathematical models are out of line, therefore, we sought to compare different models and their prediction results, so as to generate objective conclusions. 
Methods: We used the number of cases reported from January 23 to March 20, 2020 to estimate possible spread size and peak time of COVID-19, especially in 8 high risk countries. Logistic growth model, basic SEIR model and adjusted SEIR model were adopted for predicting. Considering different model inputs may infer different model outputs, we implemented three model predictions with three scenarios of epidemic development.
Results: When contrasting all 8 countries short-term prediction results and peak predictions, the difference between the models was relatively large. The logistic growth model estimated a smaller epidemic size than the basic SERI model, however, once we added parameters which considered the effects of public health interventions and control measures, the adjusted SERI model results demonstrated a considerably rapid decelerate of the epidemic development. Our results demonstrated contact rate, quarantine scale, quarantine initiate time and length are important factors to control the epidemic size and length.
Conclusions:  We demonstrated a comparative assessment of the predictions of COVID-19 outbreak of 8 high risk countries using multiple methods. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time as well as simulating the effects of public health interventions, the intent of this paper is to help understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that quickly detecting cases, enough quarantine implementation and public self-protection behaviors are critical to slow down the epidemic.</jats:p>"

Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions.

At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on plausible epidemiological data from the literature available.

On the basis of the modelling assumptions made, ICU occupancy is likely to increase dramatically in the the days following the time of modelling. If the current exponential growth continues, 5 out of 7 commissioning regions will have more critically ill COVID-19 patients than there are ICU beds within two weeks\todo{last thing to do}. Despite variable growth in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the assumptions used.

Whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity will be required in the very near future. We hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. The uncertainties in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing real-time surveillance to allow forecasts to be constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.</jats:p>"

At the same time, we see non-China deaths increasing rapidly, and similar to the early behavior of the China statistics.  Thus, we see three stages of the spread of the disease in terms of number of deaths: exponential growth, power-law behavior, and then exponential decline in the daily rate.
    
    (Original abstract) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to grow rapidly in China and is spreading in other parts of the world. The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease.  However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models.  Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic.  We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.</jats:p>"

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple efforts of modelling of the geo-temporal transmissibility of the virus have been undertaken, but none succeeded in describing the pandemic at the global level. We propose a set of parameters for the first COVID-19 Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEaM). The simulation starting with just a single pre-symptomatic, yet infectious, case in Wuhan, China, results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 125 days in multiple countries across three continents.

Methods

We have built a modified SIR model and parameterized it analytically, according to the literature and by fitting the missing parameters to the observed dynamics of the virus spread. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in sixeight selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken precautions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions fit well to the empirical data.

Findings

The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, ~4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Also, the higher the testing rate per country, the lower the discrepancy between data (diagnosed cases) and model. 

Interpretation

Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.</jats:p>"

Before the implementation of control measures (e.g. social distancing, travel bans, etc) and under the assumption that infection elicits protective immunity, epidemiological theory indicates that the ongoing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 will conform to this pattern. 

Here, we calibrate a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to data on cumulative reported SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths from the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy under the assumption that such deaths are well reported events that occur only in a vulnerable fraction of the population. We focus on model solutions which take into consideration previous estimates of critical epidemiological parameters such as the basic reproduction number (R0), probability of death in the vulnerable fraction of the population, infectious period and time from infection to death, with the intention of exploring the sensitivity of the system to the actual fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease and death. 

Our simulations are in agreement with other studies that the current epidemic wave in the UK and Italy in the absence of interventions should have an approximate duration of 2-3 months, with numbers of deaths lagging behind in time relative to overall infections. Importantly, the results we present here suggest the ongoing epidemics in the UK and Italy started at least a month before the first reported death and have already led to the accumulation of significant levels of herd immunity in both countries. There is an inverse relationship between the proportion currently immune and the fraction of the population vulnerable to severe disease. 

This relationship can be used to determine how many people will require hospitalisation (and possibly die) in the coming weeks if we are able to accurately determine current levels of herd immunity. There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.</jats:p>"

Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment.
Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality.
Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P&lt;0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P&lt;0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS.
Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.</jats:p>"

The model takes into account the known or reported number of infected cases being fewer than the actual number of infected individuals due to insufficient testing. The model integrates intercity travel data to track the movement of exposed and infected individuals among cities, and allows different levels of active intervention to be considered so that realistic prediction of the number of infected individuals can be performed. The data of the COVID-19 infection cases and the intercity travel data for Japan (January 15 to March 20, 2020) and the USA (February 20 to March 20, 2020) are used to illustrate the prediction of the pandemic progression in 47 regions of Japan and 50 states (plus a federal district) in the USA. By fitting the model with the data, we reveal that, as of March 19, 2020, the number of infected individuals in Japan and the USA could be twenty-fold and five-fold as many as the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Moreover, the model generates future progression profiles for different levels of intervention by setting the parameters relative to the values found from the data fitting. Results show that without tightening the implementation of active intervention, Japan and the USA will see about 6.55% and  18.2% of the population eventually infected, and with drastic ten-fold elevated active intervention, the number of people eventually infected can be reduced by up to 95% in Japan and 70% in the USA. Finally, an assessment of the relative effectiveness of active intervention and personal protective measures is discussed. With a highly vigilant public maintaining personal hygiene and exercising strict protective measures, the percentage of population infected can be further reduced to 0.23% in Japan and 2.7% in the USA.</jats:p>"

Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem.
Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people (P&lt;0.001).

We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections.

Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions.

Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population.

Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran's situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak. Both Europe and the USA are at early stages of the outbreak, posing significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures.</jats:p>"

Many drugs showed potential for COVID-19 therapy. However, genetic factors which can lead to different drug efficiency and toxicity among populations are still undisclosed in COVID-19 therapy. 
Methods: We selected 67 potential drugs for COVID-19 therapy (DCTs) from clinical guideline and clinical trials databases. 313 pharmaco-genes related to these therapeutic drugs were included. Variation information in 125,748 exomes were collected for racial differences analyses. The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults.
Results: Pharmacogenes, including CYP3A4, ABCB1, SLCO1B1, ALB, CYP3A5, were involved in the process of more than multi DCTs. 224 potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) of DCTs were predicted, while 112 of them have been reported. Racial discrepancy of common nonsynonymous mutations was found in pharmacogenes including: VDR, ITPA, G6PD, CYP3A4 and ABCB1 which related to DCTs including ribavirin, α-interferon, chloroquine and lopinavir. Moreover, ACE2, the target of 2019-nCoV, was only found in parts of lung cells, which makes drugs like chloroquine that prevent virus binding to ACE2 more specific than other targeted drugs such as camostat mesylate. 
Conclusions: At least 17 drugs for COVID-19 therapy with predictable pharmacogenes should be carefully utilized in risk races which are consisted of more risk allele carriers. At least 29 drugs with potential of DDIs are reported to be affected by other DDIs, they should be replaced by similar drugs without interaction if it is possible.

Summary: COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and was first reported in central China in December 2019. Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required as the number of cases imported from other countries is increasing.</jats:p>"

Type II was likely evolved from Type I and predominant in the infections. Our results suggest that Type II SARS-CoV-2 was the source of the outbreak in the Wuhan Huanan market and it was likely originated from a super-spreader. The outbreak caused by the Type I virus should have occurred somewhere else, because the patients had no direct link to the market. Furthermore, by analyzing three genomic sites that distinguish Type I and Type II strains, we found that synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II strains are predominant, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I.

The COVID 19 outbreak is posing an unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers. This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19.
Method
Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years.
Results
Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hubei Province (10.4%), and the rest of China (7.0%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20 to 59 years 0.3% (5/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193/29,798), respectively.
Conclusion
The disease severity improved considerably over a short period of time in China. The more severe conditions in Wuhan compared to the rest of the country may be attributable to the draconian lockdown. The clinical outcomes of infected Chinese healthcare workers may represent a more accurate estimation of the severity of COVID 19 for those who have access to quality healthcare.</jats:p>"

Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients.

To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28  predicted proteins was constructed.

S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified.

Although the Chinese government implemented a number of severe restrictions on people's movement in an attempt to contain its local and international spread, the virus had already reached many areas of the world in part due to its potent transmissibility and the fact that a substantial fraction of infected individuals develop little or no symptoms at all. Following its emergence, the virus started to generate sustained transmission in neighboring countries in Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States, and finally in South America and Africa. As the virus continues its global spread, a clear and evidence-based understanding of properties and dynamics of the global transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to design and put in place efficient and globally coordinated interventions.  

Methods: We employ molecular surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics for inference and comprehensive analysis of its global transmission network before the pandemic declaration. Our goal was to characterize the spatial-temporal transmission pathways that led to the establishment of the pandemic.  We exploited a network-based approach specifically tailored to emerging outbreak settings. Specifically, it traces the accumulation of mutations in viral genomic variants via mutation trees, which are then used to infer transmission networks, revealing an up-to-date picture of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 between and within countries and geographic regions. 

Results and Conclusions:
The analysis suggest multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the majority of world regions by means of heterogeneous transmission pathways. The transmission network is scale-free, with a few genomic variants responsible for the majority of possible transmissions. The network structure is in line with the available temporal information represented by sample collection times and suggest the expected sampling time difference of few days between potential transmission pairs.
The inferred network structural properties, transmission clusters and pathways and virus introduction routes emphasize the extent of the global epidemiological linkage and demonstrate the importance of internationally coordinated public health measures.</jats:p>"

These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. 
Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. 
Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. 
Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people.
Time horizon: 200 days.
Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). 
Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2.
Results of Base-Case analysis: The number of expected deaths is 389 in strategy 1 versus 432  in strategy 2. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in case of adhering to global isolation will be $ 102,383,282 to prevent one case of death. 
Results of sensitivity analysis: The ICER value is between $ 22.5 million to over $280 million per one avoided death.
Conclusions: According to our model, global isolation will save ~43 more lives compared to a strategy of focused isolation and extensive screening. This benefit is implicated in tremendous costs that might result in overwhelming economic effects. 
Limitations: Compartment models do not necessarily fit to countries with heterogeneous populations. In addition, we rely on current published parameters that might not reliably reflect infection dynamics.</jats:p>"

Aim: We assessed the cumulative change in the incidence and case-fatality rates of COVID-19 at the global, regional, and national levels from January to March 16, 2020, in 154 affected countries and territories globally.
Methods: We collected data of COVID-19 cases using the GitHub repository, which provided real-time surveillance information developed by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), Johns Hopkins University (USA). Information such as confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries reported across all affected countries was collected from January 22 to March 16, 2020.

Objectives: To assess outcomes in patients who have severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and were treated with either China guideline based Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) plus standard care or standard care alone.
Design: A pilot randomized controlled trial.
Setting Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Wuhan, China
Patients: A total of 42 adults with severe COVID-19.
Interventions: Participants in the CHM plus standard care group received CHM and standard care, and the control group received standard care alone.
Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment at 7 days. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]; 21 [50%] were aged ≥ 65 years; and 35 [83%] women, 42 (100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift towards death was lower in the CHM plus group than the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148 to 2.352 P=.454). Three (2 from the CHM plus group and 1 from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 18% (5) vs 14% (2), 71% (20) vs 64% (9), and 0% (0) vs 7% (1) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone. 
Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. CHM effects in COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies.</jats:p>"

Methods: Comprehensive searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and relevant CPG publishers/repositories were carried out in early March 2020. Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers.
Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment (n=13), social distancing or isolation (n=13), disinfecting surfaces (n=12), droplet precautions (n=12), surveillance and evaluation (n=11), and using diagnostic testing to confirm illness (n=10). While only two or more CPGs recommended these infection control measures: policies and procedures for visitors, staff and/or residents (n=9), respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette (n=9), providing supplies (n=9), staff and/or residents education (n=8), increasing communication (n=6), consulting or notifying health professionals (n=6), appropriate ventilation practices (n=2), and cohorting equipment (n=2). Ten CPGs also addressed management of viral respiratory infections in LTCF and recommended antiviral chemoprophylaxis (n=10) and one CPG recommended early mobilization of residents.
Conclusion: The recommendations from current guidelines overall seem to support environmental measures for infection prevention and antiviral chemoprophylaxis for infection management as the most appropriate first-line response to viral respiratory illness in long-term care.</jats:p>"

We performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 directly from PCR-positive clinical specimens and conducted a haplotype network analysis of the outbreak. All tested isolates exhibited a transversion at G11083T, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 dissemination on the DP originated from a single introduction event before the quarantine started. Although further spreading might have been prevented by quarantine, some progeny clusters were linked to transmission through mass-gathering events in the recreational areas and direct transmission among passengers who shared cabins during the quarantine. This study demonstrates the usefulness of haplotype network analysis in identifying potential infection routes.</jats:p>"

To provide sufficient information for all involved decision-makers (clinicians, public health authorities, drug regulatory agencies) a multiplicity of endpoints must be considered. It is a challenge to generate detailed high quality evidence from data while ensuring fast availability and evaluation of the results.

Methods:	We reviewed all interventional COVID-19 trials on Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine registered in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and summarized the endpoints used to assess treatment effects. We propose a multistate model that harmonizes heterogeneous endpoints and differing lengths of follow-up within and between trials. 

Results:		There are currently, March 27, 2020, 23 registered interventional trials investigating the potential benefits of Remdesivir, Lopinavir/ritonavir and Hydroxychloroquine. The endpoints are highly heterogeneous. Follow-up for the primary endpoints ranges from four to 168 days.
 A detailed precisely defined endpoint has been proposed by the global network REMAP-CAP, which is specialized on community-acquired pneumonia. Their seven-category endpoint accounts for major clinical events informative for all decision-makers. Moreover, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative is currently working on a core outcome set. We propose a multistate model that accommodates analysis of these recommended endpoints. The model allows for a detailed investigation of treatment effects for various endpoints over the course of time thereby harmonizing differing endpoints and lengths of follow-up.

Conclusion:	Multistate model analysis is a powerful tool to study clinically heterogeneous endpoints (mortality, discharge) as well as endpoints influencing hospital capacities (duration of hospitalization and ventilation) simultaneously over time. Our proposed model extracts all information available in the data and is - by harmonizing endpoints within and between trials - a step towards faster decision making. All ongoing clinical trials, especially those with severe cases, should accommodate primary analysis with a stacked probability plot of the major events mechanical ventilation, discharge alive and death.</jats:p>"

As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus.
| Methods: We adopted the Huike database to extract news articles about coronavirus from major press media, between January 1st, 2020, to February 20th, 2020. The data were sorted and analyzed by Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number using the coherence number. We operated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling with the suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into two-dimensional plane via multidimensional scaling. | Findings: After removing duplicates, 7791 relevant news reports were identified. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as our number of topics and obtained their names and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, global/local social/economic influences, accounting for 32.6%, 16.6%, 11.8% of the collected reports respectively.  | Interpretation: The Chinese mass media news reports lag behind the COVID-19 outbreak development. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a global issue, and society has also become concerned about donation and support as well as mental health. We recommend that future work should address the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.</jats:p>"

It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism amongst healthcare workers with dependent children, but there is a need for detailed high-resolution analysis of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and absenteeism across the United States. At the national level, we estimate the projected absenteeism rate to range from 7.5% to 8.6%, and the effectiveness of school closures to range from 172 to 218 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. At the county-level, we find substantial variations of projected absenteeism and school closure effects, ranging from 2.0% to 18.6% absenteeism and 88 to 280 fewer hospital beds used per 100,000 people at peak demand. We also find significant associations between levels of absenteeism and COVID-19 complication factors. We observe from our models that an estimated 98.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures, identifying child care subsidization as a potential solution to help maintain healthcare systems during a pandemic.</jats:p>"

Heart injury can be easily induced by viral infection such as adenovirus and enterovirus. However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated.
Objective:
To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later.
Design, Setting, and Participants
A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020.
Exposures: 
High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; α-HBDH).
Main Outcomes and Measures:
Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days).
Results:
Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (≥ 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and α-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and α-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and α-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022).
Conclusions and Relevance:
Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.</jats:p>"

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 ℃ prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.</jats:p>"

Travellers from the region rapidly became the most common source of imported infections in the earliest stage of the Norwegian COVID-19 epidemic. The situation was exacerbated by the unfortunate temporal overlap between the Norwegian winter holidays and intense epidemic spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, resulting in a large number of infected travellers. Here we combined flight data on travels between Norway and Lombardy with patient-level data to determine the fraction of travellers returning to Norway that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Travellers returning to Norway from Lombardy contracted COVID-19 at incidence rates up to 0.02 per person-day in the period spanning February 21st and March 1st, with a clear uptick in transmission in the middle of the period.
This shows an example of the infection risk in tourist destinations being several fold higher than elsewhere in the region. In Norway, this is also supported by high rates of infections among tourists returning from Austria in February and March, despite a low number of reported cases in the country at the time.
The massive COVID-19 prevalence among travellers suggest that mandatory quarantine of returning travellers or suspension of non-essential international flights is essential if the aim is to control or suppress the COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is significant to understand the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods:  In this single-center, retrospective and observational study, we collected data from 167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (Chongqing, China) from January to March 2020. The epidemiological characteristics and variable of these patients were collected and analyzed. 
Findings:  82.04% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had a travel history in Wuhan or a history of contact with returnees from Wuhan, showing typical characteristics of imported cases, and the proportion of severe Covid-19 patients was 13.2%, of which 59% were imported from Wuhan. For the patients who was returnees from Wuhan, 18.1% was asymptomatic patients. In different infection periods, compared with the proportion after 1/31/2020, the proportion of asymptomatic patient among SARS-CoV-2 infected patient was higher(19% VS 1.5%). In different age groups, the proportion of asymptomatic patient was the highest(28.6%) in children group under 14, next in elder group over 70 (27.3%).

The dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmissibility after symptom onset remains unknown.

Methods
We conducted a prospective case-ascertained study on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and their contacts. Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) was analyzed for different exposure windows after symptom onset of index cases and for different exposure settings.

Results
Thirty-two confirmed patients were enrolled and 12 paired data (index-secondary cases) were identified among the 1,043 contacts. The secondary clinical attack rate was 0.9% (95% CI 0.5-1.7%). The attack rate was higher among those whose exposure to index cases started within five days of symptom onset (2.4%, 95% CI 1.1-4.5%) than those who were exposed later (zero case from 605 close contacts, 95% CI 0-0.61%). The attack rate was also higher among household contacts (13.6%, 95% CI 4.7-29.5%) and non-household family contacts (8.5%, 95% CI 2.4-20.3%) than that in healthcare or other settings. The higher secondary clinical attack rate for contacts near symptom onset remained when the analysis was restricted to household and family contacts. There was a trend of increasing attack rate with the age of contacts (p for trend &lt; 0.001).

Conclusions
High transmissibility of COVID-19 near symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized social distancing measures are required. Rapid reduction of transmissibility over time implies that prolonged hospitalization of mild cases might not be necessary in large epidemics.</jats:p>"

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach.
METHODS：We established a reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 on 194 clinical pharyngeal swab samples, including 103 suspected patients, 75 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents. 
RESULTS: The limit of blanks (LoBs) of the RT-dPCR assays were ~1.6, ~1.6 and ~0.8 copies/reaction for ORF 1ab, N and E genes, respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients. 
CONCLUSION: RT-dPCR could be a confirmatory method for suspected patients diagnosed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, RT-dPCR was more sensitive and suitable for low viral load specimens from the both patients under isolation and those under observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.</jats:p>"

The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes.

There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has important implications for early treatment.

Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. 

Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 2020 were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse-probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed.

Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p&lt;0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p&lt;0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk: every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p&lt;0.001).

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing guidelines require alternative data collection in order protect both research staff and participants. Home-collected respiratory specimens are less resource intensive, can be collected earlier after symptom onset, and provide a low-contact means of data collection. A prospective, multi-year, community-based cohort study is an ideal setting to examine the utility of home-collected specimens for identification of influenza.

Methods: We describe the feasibility and reliability of home-collected specimens for the detection of influenza. We collected data and specimens between October 2014 and June 2017 from the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation (HIVE) Study. Cohort participants were asked to collect a nasal swab at home upon onset of acute respiratory illness. Research staff also collected nose and throat swab specimens in the study clinic within 7 days of onset. We estimated agreement using Cohen's kappa and calculated sensitivity and specificity of home-collected compared to staff-collected specimens.  

Results: We tested 336 paired staff- and home-collected respiratory specimens for influenza by RT-PCR; 150 staff-collected specimens were positive for influenza A/H3N2, 23 for influenza A/H1N1, 14 for influenza B/Victoria, and 31 for influenza B/Yamagata. We found moderate agreement between collection methods for influenza A/H3N2 (0.70) and B/Yamagata (0.69) and high agreement for influenza A/H1N1 (0.87) and B/Victoria (0.86). Sensitivity ranged from 78-86% for all influenza types and subtypes. Specificity was high for influenza A/H1N1 and both influenza B lineages with a range from 96-100%, and slightly lower for A/H3N2 infections (88%).

Conclusions: Collection of nasal swab specimens at home is both feasible and reliable for identification of influenza virus infections.</jats:p>"

Findings: Based on 1,407 COVID-19 reported infection events in China outside of Hubei Province between 20 January and 19 February 2020, we estimate the distribution of secondary infection sizes, frequency of super spreading events, serial intervals and age-stratified hazard of infection. Young and older people have higher risks of being infected with households while males 65+ of age are responsible for a disproportionate number of household infections.

A retrospective analysis of the dynamic transmission routes,"<jats:p>The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the 2019-nCoV, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 - February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-province routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV.</jats:p>"

The importance of being tested.","<jats:p>There is big concern for estimating the lethality and the extent of undetected infections associated with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 outbreak. While detailed epidemiological models are certainly needed, I suggest here an orthogonal approach based on a minimum number of parameters robustly fitted from the cumulative data easily accessible for all countries at the John Hopkins University database that became the worldwide reference for the pandemics. I show that, after few days from the beginning of the outbreak, the apparent death rate can be extrapolated to infinite time through regularized regression such as rescaled ridge regression. The variation from country to country of these extrapolated death rates appears to depend almost only (r^2=0.91) on the ratio between performed tests and detected cases even when the instantaneous apparent lethality rates are as different as 9% in Italy and 0.4% in Germany. Extrapolating to the limit of infinite number of tests, I obtain a death rate of 0.012+/- 0.012, in agreement with other estimates. The inverse relationship between the extrapolated death rate and the intensity tests allows estimating that more than 50% of cases were undetected in most countries, with more than 90% undetected cases in countries severely hit by the epidemics such as Italy. Finally, I propose to adopt the ratio between the cumulative number of recovered and deceased persons as an indicator that can anticipate the halting of the epidemics.</jats:p>"

BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated.
METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. 
RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064)
CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.</jats:p>"

DT represents the time it takes before the number of COVID-19 cases, in a certain country or area, doubles. 
Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, DT values are continually changing. These changes are influenced by the measures that are recommended by the health authorities and implemented by governments. 
After the governmental shutdowns of Nordic Countries that were announced around the 12th of March 2020, I followed the development of the DT in the region. Governments put in place measure never before experienced during peace time; home working, closed schools and kindergartens, travel bans and social distancing. But does it work?  The initial set of results following the shutdown are encouraging, demonstrating a trend towards slower growth; however, this could be reversed if the measures that are in place now are abandoned too early. Premature optimism can be very costly. This paper explains how to monitor growth in real time and evaluate whether the implemented measures are successful.</jats:p>"

However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.
Study design: Rapid evidence review.
Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak.
Results: We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. 
Conclusions: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.</jats:p>"

Modelling interactions between the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses,"<jats:p>Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show that the inherent randomness of societal processes can lead to a wide range of possible outcomes, both in terms of disease dynamics and mortality, even when the principles according to which policy and population operate are identical.. Our model is easily modified to take other aspects of the socio-pandemic interaction into account.</jats:p>"

Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure.
METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six patients with postmortem examinations in the other hospital were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen, immune cell markers (CD8, CD68 and CD56) and the complement C5b-9 was detected by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF). The eldery patients and cases with comorbidities such as hypertension and heart failure more easily developed ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p&lt; 0.001; 69.57% vs 11.29%, p&lt; 0.001, respectively). H&amp;E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. Viral infection not only induces CD68+ macrophages infiltrated into tubulointerstitium, but also enhances complement C5b-9 deposition on tubules.  
CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 induces ARF in COVID-19 patients. Viruses directly infect human kidney tubules to induce acute tubular damage. The viruses not only have direct cytotoxicity, but also initiate CD68+ macrophage together with complement C5b-9 deposition to mediate tubular pathogenesis.</jats:p>"

We execute a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across all known HLA -A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explore the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome is successfully sampled and presented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity. Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.</jats:p>"

We employ a set of difference-in-differences (DID) estimations to disentangle the lockdown effect on human mobility reductions from other confounding effects including panic effect, virus effect, and the Spring Festival effect. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. We also estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find, using simulations with these estimates, that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in the 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, but over time, the gap between the officially reported cases and our estimated ""actual"" cases narrows significantly. We also find evidence that enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province are effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere.</jats:p>"

However, a retrospective surveillance study identified six children who had been hospitalized for COVID-19 in one of three central Wuhan hospitals between January 7th and January 15th. Given that Wuhan has over 395 other hospitals, there may have been far more severe pediatric cases than reported. There were six and 43 children out of 336 who tested positive for COVID-19 and influenza, respectively among all pediatric admissions during the 9-day period. By using this ratio in a detailed analysis of influenza surveillance data and COVID-19 epidemic dynamics (see Appendix), we estimate that there were 313 [95% CI: 171-520] children hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan during January 7-15, 2020 (Figure). Under an epidemic doubling time of 7.31 days4, we estimate that there were 1105 [95% CI: 592, 1829] cumulative pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations prior to the January 23rd lockdown, which far surpasses the 425 confirmed cases reported across all age groups, none of which were children under age 15. Children are strikingly absent from COVID-19 reports and limited data suggest that pediatric infections are overwhelmingly mild5. Thus, our estimates for hundreds of severe pediatric cases likely translates to thousands or even tens of thousands of mildly infected children, suggesting that the force of infection from children may be grossly underestimated and the infection fatality rate overestimated from confirmed case counts alone. This highlights the urgent need for more robust surveillance to gauge the true extent and severity of COVID-19 in all ages.</jats:p>"

Reprocessing of used N95 respirators may ameliorate supply chain constraints during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative. The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. 

We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce HP vapors. Virucidal activity was measured by a standard plaquing assay prior to and after sterilization. A single HP vapor cycle resulted in complete eradication of phage from masks (limit of detection 10 PFU, lower than the infectious dose of the majority of respiratory viral pathogens). After 5 cycles, the respirators appeared similar to new with no deformity. 

Use of a Bioquell machine can be scaled to permit simultaneous sterilization of a large number of used but otherwise intact respirators. HP vapor reprocessing may ease shortages and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative to non-NIOSH masks.</jats:p>"

Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on COV-19, and reported to be efficient in Chinese patients infected by this virus. We evaluate the role of Hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. 
Patients and methods
Patients were included in a single arm protocol to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasal swabs was tested daily. Depending on their clinical presentation azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative control. Presence and absence of virus at Day-6 was considered the end point.
Results
Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D-6 compared to controls, and much lower than reported average carrying duration of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to Hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.
Conclusion : Hydroxychloroquine is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in patients with COVID-19 and its effect is reinforced by Azithromycin.</jats:p>"

SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is a golden standard for defining the recovery of COVID-19 infections. To dissect the underlying diseases that could impact on viral clearance, we enrolled 106 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China between Jan 5 and Feb 25, 2020.
Methodology: We comprehensively analyzed demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as patient treatment records. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modelling were employed to identify factors influencing the viral clearance negatively. 
Results: We found that increasing age, male gender, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) associated factors (including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases) adversely affected the viral clearance. Furthermore, analysis by a random forest survival model pointed out hypertension, cortisone treatment, gender, and age as the four most important variables. 
Conclusions: We conclude that patients at old age, males, and/or having diseases associated with high expression of ACE2 will have worse prognosis during a COVID-19 infections.</jats:p>"

SARS-CoV-2 has caused a series of COVID-19 globally. SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia
METHODS:
The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. 
RESULTS:
By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. 
Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P&gt;0.05).  Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P&lt;0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia.  severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. 
CONCLUSIONS:
Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system.</jats:p>"

Here, we report a super-spreading transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2 involving an index patient, seven cancer patients, 40 health care workers and four family members.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to identify the index patient and the exposed individuals linked to a chain of transmission associated with COVID-19. We collected and analyzed the data on demographic features, exposure history, clinical presentation, laboratory investigation, radiological examination, and disease outcome of these patients.
Results: We identified the index patient and another presumptive super-spreader, who initiated and amplified a super-spreading transmission chain associated with COVID-19, respectively. There were 31 female and 21 male patients in this cohort, and the median age was 37 years (range: 22-79 years). Each of them had an exposure history with the index patient or his close contacts. Approximately 87% (45/52) of the patients had fever or other symptoms, 96% (50/52) had abnormal chest CT-scan findings, 86% of the tested patients (39/45) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimen, 85% of the tested patients (29/34) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and/or IgG, 15% of the RT-PCR positive patients were tested negative for the specific IgM and/or IgG at the convalescent phase, and 15% of the RT-PCR negative patients were tested positive for the specific IgM and/or IgG. The severe patients experienced a significant decrease in oximetry saturation, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, along with a significant increase in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase. All six fatal cases had comorbidities and five of the seven cancer patients (71%) died within 2-20 days of the disease onset. 
Conclusions: The super-spreading events were associated with the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan and its impact on disease transmission warrants further investigation. Cancer patients appeared highly vulnerable to COVID-19. The finding that a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were tested negative for the serum specific IgM and IgG at the convalescent phase should be addressed by additional studies.</jats:p>"

Immune system dysregulation such as lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm has been observed in COVID-19 patients, but it remains unclear for the change of key immune cell subsets and their states during COVID-19. Here, we applied single-cell technology to comprehensively characterize transcriptional changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ten patients recovered from COVID-19. Compared with healthy control, COVID-19 induced a unique signature of immune cells in humans, especially in the early recovery stage (ERS). In ERS patients, T cells were decreased remarkably, while monocytes were increased. A detailed analysis of monocytes showed that there was an increased ratio of classical CD14++ monocytes with highly inflammatory genes expression, as well as a greater abundance of CD14++IL1B+ monocytes. For nature killer (NK) cells and T cells, CD4+ T cells were significantly decreased and expressed high level of inflammatory markers, while NK cells were increased. In addition, T cells were highly expanded clone, especially in CD4+ T memory cells and CD8+ T cells. Among B cells, plasma cells were increased remarkably, and naïve B cells were reduced. Our study also identified several novel B cell receptor (BCR) changes (such as IGHV1-8 and IGHV3-7), and confirmed isotypes (IGKV3-11 and IGHV3-21) previously used for virus vaccine development. The strongest pairing frequencies, IGHV3-23+IGHJ4, indicated a monoclonal state associated with SARS-CoV-2 specificity. Furthermore, integrated analysis predicated that IL-1B and M-CSF may be novel candidate target gene for inflammatory storm, and TNFSF13, IL-18 and IL-4 may be benefit for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. Our study provides the first evidence of inflammatory immune signature in early recovery stage, suggesting that the COVID-19 patients are still vulnerable after hospital discharge.

Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient.
Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD16+56+ NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis.
Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died.
Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of COVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.</jats:p>"

In the present study, we analyzed both the changes in the cellularity of various immune cell types as well as cytokines important for immune reactions and inflammation. Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay underwent a similar ""rise-decline"" pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.</jats:p>"

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19.

Methods: We reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R_t), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1).

Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. In the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. 

Implications: Containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID-19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID-19 continues to spread globally.

Tracking case numbers over time allows us to determine speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. Changing case definitions during an epidemic can affect these inferences.

Methods: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used simple models assuming exponential growth and then exponential decay to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the numbers of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic.

Findings: From January through to early March 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. As of February 20, there were 55,508 confirmed cases reported in mainland China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed from version 1 to 2, version 2 to 4 and version 4 to 5, the proportion of infections being detected as cases were increased by 7.1-fold (95% credible interval (CI): 4.8, 10.9), 2.8-fold (95% CI: 1.9, 4.2) and 4.2-fold (95% CI: 2.6, 7.3) respectively. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak, we estimated that by February 20 there would have been 232,000 (95% CI: 161,000, 359,000) confirmed cases.

Interpretation: The case definition was initially narrow, but was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan or other known cases. This should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

The dissemination of COVID-19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.</jats:p>"

Objective: To quantify the impact of increasing COVID-19 infection on extent of psychiatric assessment across 5 Eastern Massachusetts hospitals.
Design: In silico cohort using narrative clinical notes generated between 1/2/2020 and 3/25/2020
Setting: Emergency department and outpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 3 community hospitals
Participants: All individuals age 13 and older presenting to emergency department or outpatient clinics 
Main Outcome or Measure: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms reflecting depression, anxiety, psychosis, or suicide, and documentation of violence, was drawn from previously-validated term lists.
Results: A total of 2,483,159 outpatient and 205,957 emergency department visit notes were analyzed. Instances of notes referencing depression or anxiety decreased 75-81% in outpatient settings with onset of coronavirus in March 2019, and by 44-45% in emergency departments. In adjusted logistic regression, presence of individual psychiatric symptoms in outpatient notes was associated with significant decreases in likelihood of coronavirus testing (for depression, OR=0.636, 95% CI 0.606-0.667). Conversely, presence of violence in an emergency department note was associated with greater likelihood of testing (OR=1.487, 95% CI 1.249-1.761).  
Conclusions and Relevance: Documentation of psychiatric symptoms in both outpatient and emergency department settings diminished sharply in the context of increasing coronavirus infection in Massachusetts, suggesting that efforts to provide additional resources to manage psychiatric symptoms will be needed.

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the ongoing seasonal influenza activity.
 
Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to the spread of COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses.
 
Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention).  
 
Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of rapidly spreading awareness on the use of these self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low levels of exposed and infectious numbers that are conducive to subsequent management. Our results point to a two-step control strategy that begins with some level of confinement to reduce R below 1, followed by sufficient mitigation measures that manage the epidemic by maintaining R at approximately 1.</jats:p>"

Deep learning was reported to discover intricate structures from clinical images and achieve expert-level performance in medical image analysis. To develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for auto-detection of NCP, particularly focusing on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP).
Methods: 35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020. The external validation set enrolled 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from eight centers. 
Results: 96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP lesions which had nodules ranging 5-10 mm. The classification schemes accurately distinguished NCP and IP lesions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.93. The Trinary scheme was more device-independent and consistent with specialists than the Plain scheme, which achieved a F1 score of 0.847, higher than the Plain scheme (0.774), specialists (0.785) and residents (0.644).

Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death.

A pandemic of 2019 novel corona virus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan city, has affected more than 100,000 patients worldwide. Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of COVID-19, but currently, there is no guidance on the management of cancer patients during this outbreak. Here, we report the infection control measures and early outcomes of patients who received radiotherapy (RT) at a tertiary cancer centre in Wuhan.
Methods
We reviewed all patients who were treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (ZHWU) from Jan 20 to Mar 6, 2020. This preceded the city lock-down date of Jan 23, 2020. Infection control measures were implemented, which included a clinical pathway for managing suspect COVID-19 cases, on-site screening, modifications to the RT facility, and protection of healthcare workers. Primary end-point was infection rate among patients and healthcare staff. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the 5th edition criteria.
Findings
209 patients completed RT during the study period. Median age was 55 y (IQR = 48-64). Thoracic, head and neck, and lower gastrointestinal and gynaecological cancer patients consisted the majority of patients. Treatment sites included thoracic (38.3%), head and neck (25.4%), and abdomen and pelvis (25.8%); 47.4%, 27.3%, and 25.4% of treatments were for adjuvant, radical, and palliative indications, respectively. 188 treatments/day were performed prior to the lock-down, in contrast to 12.4 treatments/day post-lock-down. Only one (0.48%) patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. No healthcare worker was infected.
Interpretation
Herein, we show that in a susceptible population to COVID-19, strict infection control measures can curb human-to-human transmission, and ensure timely delivery of RT to cancer patients.</jats:p>"

associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are

Although the COVID-19 epidemic in some countries such as China are in the last phase by large effort for containment of the disease, another outbreaks can occur because huge susceptible population remains. Further, there remain countries in the early phase of outbreak with zero or limited number of cases in southern hemisphere countries. In those countries at risk of future outbreak, ascertaining whether cases are imported or the result of local secondary transmission is important for government to shape appropriate public health strategies.
Objective:
To develop a method to estimate timing of infection establishment, which helps differentiate imported and autochthonous cases.
Design, Setting and Participants:
Of the first 18 cases reported in Singapore, 12 were used in our study (1 case with insufficient data and 5 on anti-viral treatment were excluded from the analysis). The viral load data from these initial cases considered imported due to their travel history to Wuhan were analyzed. Another viral load data from 3 cases reported from Zhuhai, China, for whom exposed day were known, were also analyzed to determine the viral load threshold for infection establishment.
Exposures:
SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test. 
Main Outcomes and Measures:
The timing of infection establishment of each case was assessed by analysing viral load data after symptom onset using a within-host viral dynamics model for SARS-CoV-2. Estimated timing of infection will indicate whether cases are imported or autochthonous transmission within Singapore.
Results:
Six among the 12 cases were clearly imported cases, whereas we could not rule out the possibility of secondary transmission for the rest of 6 cases, which collectively evidenced ongoing transmission in Singapore. For the 6 cases who could be the results of secondary transmission, further investigation to identify the source of infection within Singapore should be warranted (i.e., contact tracing).
Conclusions and Relevance:
	In an early phase of outbreak due to entrance or re-entrance of the virus to countries/communities, collecting viral load data over time from cases from symptom onset is highly recommended, because viral load data are valuable to infer the timing of infection and distinguish between imported cases and ongoing local transmission.</jats:p>"

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely pandemic all over the world. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 COVID-19 patients. 
Methods. Two hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patient's prognosis was tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. 
Results. Of 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. 
Conclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>"

Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication.

There is great attention for the diffusion and evolution of the CoVid-19 infection which started from the north (particularly in the Lombardia region) and it is now rapidly affecting other Italian regions.
We investigate on the impact of patients hospitalisation in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) at a regional and subregional granularity. We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it.

As exploratory studies have suggested that interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in cases of complicated COVID-19 and that the anti-IL-6 biologic tocilizumab may be beneficial, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence in this field.
Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies investigating the immunological response in COVID-19 or its treatment with tocilizumab; additional grey literature searches were undertaken. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random effects models.
Results: Eight published studies, three pre-prints, and five registered trials were eligible. Meta-analysis of mean IL-6 concentrations demonstrated 2.9-fold higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared with patients with non-complicated disease (six studies; n=1302; 95%CI, 1.17-7.19; I2=100%). A single non-randomized, single-arm study assessed tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19, demonstrating decreased oxygen requirements, resolution of radiographic abnormalities, and clinical improvement. No adverse events or deaths were observed.
Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. While inhibition of IL-6 with tocilizumab appears to be efficacious and safe in preliminary investigation, the results of several ongoing clinical trials should be awaited to better define the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 prior to routine clinical application.</jats:p>"

At present two central public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5]). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8]. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well recognized roles in estimating prevalence [10, 11] and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies [12-15].</jats:p>"

Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% &amp; 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation.
Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less.
Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.</jats:p>"

An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020.
Methods
We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. 
Results
The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (R-square&gt;0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both COVID-19 and SARS. While all three population groups of SARS are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19.
Conclusions
Our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well. Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro  in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.</jats:p>"

The outbreak of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease (Covid-19) has become pandemic. To be more effectively controlling the disease, it is critical to set up an optimal quarantine period so that about 95% of the cases developing symptoms will be retained for isolation. At the moment, the WHO-established quarantine period is 14 days based on previous reports which had studied small sizes of hospitalized cases (10 and ~100, respectively), however, over 80% of adult- and 95% of child-cases were not necessary to stay in hospitals, and therefore, had not been hospitalized. Therefore, we are questioning if the current-inferred median incubation time is representative for the whole Covid-19 population, and if the current quarantine period is optimal.   

Methods
We compiled and analyzed the patient-level information of 2015 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases including 99 children in 28 Chinese provinces. This cohort represents a wide-range spectrum of Covid-19 disease with both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. 

Results
The full range of incubation periods of the Covid-19 cases ranged from 0 to 33 days among 2015 cases. There were 6 (0.13%) symptom-free cases including 4 females with a median age of 25.5 years and 2 males with a median age of 36 years. The median incubation period of both male and female adults was similar (7-day) but significantly shorter than that (9-day) of child cases (P=0.02). This cohort contained 4 transmission generations, and incubation periods of the cases between generations were not significantly different, suggesting that the virus has not been rapidly adapted to human beings. Interestingly, incubation periods of 233 cases (11.6%) were longer than the WHO-established quarantine period (14 days). Data modeling suggested that if adults take an extra 4-day or 7-day of isolation (i.e., a quarantine period of 18 or 21 days), 96.2% or 98.3%, respectively, of the people who are developing symptoms will be more effectively quarantined. Patients transmitted via lunch/dinner parties (i.e., gastrointestinal tract infection through oral transmission) had a significantly longer incubation period (9-day) than other adults transmitted via respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces and objects (P&lt;0.004). 

Conclusions 
The whole Covid-19 population including both hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases had a median incubation period of 7-day for adults, which is 1.8-day longer than the hospitalized cases reported previously. An extension of the adult quarantine period to 18 days or 21 days could be more effective in preventing virus-spreading and controlling the disease. The cases transmitted by lunch/dinner parties could be infected first in the gastrointestinal tract through oral transmission and then infected in the respiratory system so that they had a longer incubation period.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to investigate how and from when Japanese citizens have changed their precautionary behavior under these circumstances, where the government has only requested their cooperation. This study uses micro data from a cross-sectional survey conducted on an online platform of an online research company, based on quota sampling that is representative of the Japanese population. By the end of March 2020, we had recruited a total of 11,342 respondents, aged from 20 to 64 years. About 85% reported practising the social distancing recommended by the government. More females than males and more older than younger participants are supportive of practicing social distancing. Frequent handwashing is conducted by 86 percent of all, 92 percent of female and 87.9 percent of over-40 participants. The most important event influencing these precautionary actions was the infection aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which occurred in early February 2020 (23%). Information from the central and local governments, received by 60% of the participants, was deemed trustworthy by 50%. However, the results also showed that about 20% of the participants were reluctant to implement proper prevention measures.

Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed.
Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count.
Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that knowledge of COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks.
Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of 1,034 U.S. residents age 18+ conducted on March 17, 2020.
Results: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and Millennial participants had 56% to 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior, compared to Baby Boomers. Results suggest politicization of response recommendations.

Yet, as there is no treatment nor a vaccine that was approved so far, universal safety precautions (USPs) and mitigating strategies are the only way to deal with this emergency crisis. However, knowledge and beliefs towards USPs among the general public in countries such as India with a large population are lacking. 
Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, web-based online survey was conducted among the general public in India during March 2020. A 20-items self-administered survey questionnaire was developed and randomly distributed among the public using google document forms through social media networks. Descriptive statistics were used in representing the study characteristics, and the Chi-square test was used in assessing the associations among the study variables with a p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.  
Results: Of 1287 participants, 1117 have given their consent of willingness and completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 86.8%. The mean age of the study participants was 28.8 ± 10.9 years, where the majority of them belong to the age category &lt;25 years, and sex was equally distributed. Based upon the socio-demographic information, the majority were post-graduates (32.9%), professional job holders (45%) and belonged to the upper-middle (40%) economic class. Overall, the knowledge and beliefs towards USPs and mitigating strategies among participants varied between moderate to high, with statistically significant associations with their socio-demographic characteristics.
Conclusions: Although the knowledge and beliefs of the general public in India towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 have been changing day-by-day rapidly. The findings of this study could guide the public health authorities in making and implementing decisions to combat this pandemic.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of global concern. Updated analysis of cases might help identify the characteristic and risk factors of the illness severity.
METHODS
We extracted data regarding 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 18, 2020. The degree of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of admission according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
RESULTS
The median age was 64.91 years, 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which, and 70.83% were severe cases. Severe patients had higher APACHE II (9.92 vs 4.74) and SOFA (3.0 vs 1.0) scores on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs 61.39), Curb-65 (1.14 vs 0.48) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs 2.0) when compared with non-severe patients. Among all univariable parameters, APACHE II, SOFA, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, AST, cTnI, BNP, et al were significantly independent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. Among which, LDH was most positively related both with APACHE II (R = 0.682) and SOFA (R = 0.790) scores, as well as PSI (R = 0.465) and CT (R = 0.837) scores. To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters, LDH (0.9727) had maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%), with the cutoff value of 283. As a protective factor, lymphocyte counts less than 1.045 x 109 /L showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC = 0.9845 (95%CI 0.959-1.01), the maximum specificity (91.30%) and sensitivity (95.24%). In addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P &lt; 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS
This study showed that LDH coule be identified as a powerful predictive factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases. And importantly,  lymphocyte counts, especially CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, which was relevant with serum LDH, were also dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease.

We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.</jats:p>"

We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection.  We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.</jats:p>"

While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The substantial number of patients with severe disease have strained intensive care capacities to an unprecedented level. Owing to the highly variable course and lack of reliable predictors for deterioration, we aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation
Patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29th February to 27th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 13/40 (32.5%) did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (p=1.2.10<jats:sup>-5</jats:sup>). In addition, the maximal IL-6 level (cutoff 80 pg/ml) for each patient during disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (p=1.7.10<jats:sup>-8</jats:sup>, AUC=0.98). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of ≥ 80 pg/ml was 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels.
In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial. Our study shows that IL-6 is an effective marker that might be able to predict upcoming respiratory failure with high accuracy and help physicians correctly allocate patients at an early stage.</jats:p>"

The ongoing worldwide outbreak of the 2019-nCoV is markedly similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. 
METHODS:
A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen.
RESULTS:
Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. Patients treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those without.
CONCLUSIONS:
IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV.</jats:p>"

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. 

Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19.

Conclusion: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.</jats:p>"

Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases.
Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Objectives
To develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Design
Cross-sectional
Setting
Multicenter
Participants
A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. 
Intervention
CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level.
Main outcomes
Short-term hospital stay (≤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (&gt;10 days).
Results
The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset. 
Conclusions 
The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study determines if it is feasible to use machine learning method to evaluate how much prediction results are close to original data related to Confirmed-Negative-Released-Death cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, a verification method is proposed  in this paper that uses the concept of Deep-learning Neural Network. In this framework, Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are also assimilated finally for training the dataset and the prediction results are tally with the results predicted by clinical doctors. The prediction results are validated against the original data based on some predefined metric. The experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is useful in generating suitable results based on the critical disease outbreak. It also helps doctors to recheck further verification of virus by the proposed method. The outbreak of  Coronavirus has the nature of  exponential growth and so it is difficult to control with limited clinical persons for handling a huge number of patients with in a reasonable time. So it is necessary to build an automated model, based on machine learning approach, for corrective measure after the decision of clinical doctors.

The ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods 
We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. 
Results
During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. 
Conclusion
Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.</jats:p>"

Methods: Using an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada, we compared a base case with limited testing, isolation, and quarantine to scenarios with: enhanced case finding; restrictive social distancing measures; or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive social distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected ICU bed occupancy. We present median and credible intervals (CrI) from 100 replicates per scenario using a two-year time horizon.

Results: We estimated that 56% (95% CrI: 42-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107,000 (95% CrI: 60,760-149,000) cases in hospital and 55,500 (95% CrI: 32,700-75,200) cases in ICU. For fixed duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive social distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the two-year period. Dynamic social distancing interventions could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity.

Interpretation: Without significant social distancing or a combination of moderate social distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed. Dynamic social distancing could maintain health system capacity and also allow periodic psychological and economic respite for populations.</jats:p>"

If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this letter, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases. The simulation results predict that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.</jats:p>"

The objective of this model is not to make forecasts but to estimate the actual number of people infected with COVID-19 during the observation window in France and to deduce the mortality rate associated with the epidemic.

Main results. The actual number of infected cases in France is probably much higher than the observations: we find here a factor x15 (95%-CI: 4-33), which leads to a 5.2/1000 mortality rate (95%-CI: 1.5/1000-11.7/1000) at the end of the observation period.

Twenty-nine patients (52.72%) were administered antibiotics, including 21 in the mild group (median treatment: 13.5 days; 15 received moxifloxacin) and all eight in the severe group (median treatment: 9 days; two received linezolid). Moreover, seven patients (12.72%) were treated with glucocorticoids and nine (16.36%) with immunomodulators.
Interpretation: Given the 100% recovery rate, early administration of antiviral drugs can be considered. Umifenovir may benefit patients with mild symptoms, while lopinavir/ritonavir may benefit those with severe symptoms. Prophylactic administration of common antibiotics may reduce the risk of co-infection. The use of glucocorticoids is usually not necessary.</jats:p>"

The present cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the mental health status and related factors of families of HCWs in Designated Hospitals in Ningbo, China. 
Method: Family members of HCWs working in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China were recruited between February 10th and 20th, 2020. Information on demographic variables, the COVID-19-related events in the lives, knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) was collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The mental health status were assessed using the Chinese version of Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9) and Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7 ). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions.
Results: A total of 822 participants completed questionnaires correctly. (response rate of 95.80% ). The overall prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms were 33.73%, and 29.35%, respectively. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), family members (that is, HCWs) directly contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients (OR=1.477, 95%CI:1.069-2.040) were risk factors for GAD, while higher participants self-reported safety score for protective equipment of HCWs (OR=0.807, 95%CI:0.700-0.930) was a protective factor. More times (hours) to focus on the COVID-19 (OR=1.215, 95%CI:1.061-1.391), longer average working times per week for family members (that is, HCWs) (OR=1.017, 95%CI:1.005-1.029), being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms (OR=3.526, 95%CI:1.609-7.728 and OR=1.639, 95%CI:1.096-2.451, respectively). In addition, compared with participants who were HCWs, participants who were enterprise workers and were more likely to develop depressive symptoms(OR=1.750, 95%CI:1.104-2.776), while who were government employees or institutions employees were less likely to suffer depressive symptoms (OR=0.529, 95%CI:0.286-0.977).
Conclusions: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to pay more attention on the mental health status of this vulnerable but often unseen populations during COVID-19 epidemic.</jats:p>"

It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 
Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245.
Findings:17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.014, HR=0.37, 95%CI[0.155-0.833]). The percentages of patients recovered to the normal lymphocyte count and CRP concentration were also increased remarkably and rapidly in meplazumab group. No adverse effect was found in meplazumab-treated patients.
Interpretation:Meplazumab efficiently improved the recovery of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile. Our results support to carry out a large-scale investigation of meplazumab as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.

Serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein have been known to be associated with the severity and mortality of community-acquired pneumonia. However, the characteristics and role of metabolic and inflammatory indicators in COVID-19 is unclear.
Methods: We included 97 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory indices; radiological features; and treatment were analysed. The differences in the clinical and laboratory parameters between mild and severe COVID-19 patients and the role of these indicators in severity prediction of COVID-19 were investigated.
Results: All were Wuhan residents with contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The median age was 39 years (IQR: 30-59). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (58.8%), cough (55.7%), and fatigue (33%). Other features were lymphopenia, impaired fasting glucose, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia. Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were found to be valuable in predicting the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe illness. Chest computed tomography (CT) images showed that the absorption of bilateral lung lesions synchronized with the recovery of metabolic and inflammatory indicators.
Conclusions: Hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia, and decreased ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% could predict severity of COVID-19. Lymphocyte count, total serum protein, and HDL-C may be potentially useful for the evaluation of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of various meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19.
Methods: 
Taking Hubei province of China as an example,where COVID-19 was first reported and there were the most cases, we collected 53 days of cases up to March 10(total 67773 confirmed cases).COVID-19 confirmed cases were retrieved from the official website of Hubei Health Commission. Ten meteorological parameters were provided by China meteorological administration,including average pressure (hPa), average temperature (°C) , maximum temperature, minimum temperature (°C), average water vapor pressure (hPa), average relative humidity (%),etc.Cross correlation analysis and linear regression were used to judge the relationship of meteorological factors and increment of COVID-19 confirmed cases.
Results: 
Under 95% CI, the increment of confirmed cases in Hubei were significantly correlated with four meteorological parameters of average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure (equivalent to absolute humidity).The average pressure was positively correlated with the increment (r=+0.358,p=0.010).The negative correlations included average temperature (r=-0.306,p=0.029), minimum air temperature (r=-0.347,p=0.013), average water vapor pressure (r=-0.326,p=0.020). The linear regression results show if minimum temperature increases by 1°C, the incremental confirmed cases in Hubei decreases by 72.470 units on average. 
Conclusion:
The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly correlated with average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure. It is positively correlated with the average pressure and negatively correlated with the other three parameters. Compared with relative humidity, 2019-nCov is more sensitive to water vapor pressure.  The reason why the epidemic situation in Hubei expanded rapidly is significantly related to the climate characteristics of low temperature and dryness of Hubei in winter.</jats:p>"

This results in a virus spreading dynamics model. The results should be verified, but because of the current time pressure, we publish them in their current state. 

Recommendations for improvement are welcome. We come to the following conclusions:
1. Complete lockdown works. About 10 days after lockdown, the infection dynamics dies down. This assumes that lockdown is complete, which can be guaranteed in the simulation, but not in reality. Still, it gives strong support to the argument that it is never too late for complete lockdown.
2. As a rule of thumb, we would suggest complete lockdown no later than once 10% of hospital capacities available for COVID-19 are in use, and possibly much earlier. This is based on the following insights:
a. Even after lockdown, the infection dynamics continues at home, leading to another tripling of the cases before the dynamics is slowed.
b. There will be many critical cases coming from people who were infected before lockdown. Because of the exponential growth dynamics, their number will be large.
c. Researchers with more detailed disease progression models should improve upon these statements.
3. Our simulations say that complete removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces and during leisure activities will not be enough to sufficiently slow down the infection dynamics. It would have been better, but still not sufficient, if initiated earlier.
4. Infections in public transport play an important role. In the simulations shown later, removing infections in the public transport system reduces the infection speed and the height of the peak by approximately 20%. Evidently, this depends on the infection parameters, which are not well known. -- This does not point to reducing public transport capacities as a reaction to the reduced demand, but rather use it for lower densities of passengers and thus reduced infection rates.
5. In our simulations, removal of infections at child care, primary schools, workplaces, leisure activities, and in public transport may barely have been sufficient to control the infection dynamics if implemented early on. Now according to our simulations it is too late for this, and (even) harsher measures will have to be initiated until possibly a return to such a restrictive, but still somewhat functional regime will again be possible.

Evidently, all of these results have to be taken with care. They are based on preliminary infection parameters taken from the literature, used inside a model that has more transport/movement details than all others that we are aware of but still not enough to describe all aspects of reality, and suffer from having to write computer code under time pressure. Optimally, they should be confirmed independently. Short of that, given current knowledge we believe that they provide justification for ""complete lockdown"" at the latest when about 10% of available hospital capacities for COVID-19 are in use (and possibly earlier; we are no experts of hospital capabilities).

What was not investigated in detail in our simulations was contact tracing, i.e. tracking down the infection chains and moving all people along infection chains into quarantine. The case of Singapore has so far shown that this may be successful. Preliminary simulation of that tactic shows that it is difficult to implement for COVID-19, since the incubation time is rather long, people are contagious before they feel sick, or maybe never feel sufficiently sick at all. We will investigate in future work if and how contact tracing can be used together with a restrictive, but not totally locked down regime.

When opening up after lockdown, it would be important to know the true fraction of people who are already immune, since that would slow down the infection dynamics by itself. For Wuhan, the currently available numbers report that only about 0.1% of the population was infected, which would be very far away from ""herd immunity"". However, there have been and still may be many unknown infections.</jats:p>"

Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis and mathematical modeling. We used the daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Estimated are based on current trends, Sampling of severe cases, hospitalization and tip of iceberg spread disease and asymptomatic, mild and moderate COVID-19 cases could not be calculated in the forecasting. Epidemic projection models of logistic growth differential equations, Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy and least squared error (LSE) method were used to predict the number of cases definitive until April 3, 2020 and April28,2020.
Results: R0 in Iran was estimated to be 4.7 that has now fallen to below 2. Given the assumptions in Models, and three different scenarios, the prediction of the patients on April 3, 2020 using three growth models of Von Bertalanffy, Gompertz and LSE were estimated at 19,500, 27,000, and 48,830, respectively. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 1707 individuals using the logistic growth model, 3165 ones by Von's model and 6300 ones according to the LSE method. Assuming continuation of the predicted trend until April 3, 2020, The prediction of the number of patients based on the Gompertz's and number of dead based on the Von's model until control the epidemic are estimated about 31000 and 5000 near April 28, 2020 respectively.
Conclusion: The process of controlling the epidemic is tangible. The most ideal scenario is the Von's model, but it is hard to fulfill and Unattainable.

This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including  asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances,  social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to implement, but it could also prove extremely costly and damaging to the economy. An alternative policy, this note argues, is to couple effective social distancing with extensive testing, even to those who are asymptomatic, and isolate the identified cases actively. Otherwise, many lives will be lost, and the health system will collapse, adding to the ongoing economic troubles that many countries have started to encounter.</jats:p>"

To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.</jats:p>"

As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is a worldwide pandemic it is rapidly expanding in Iran realtime analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions. In this study we built  a predictive model based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces. we will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases deaths and recovered for the whole country. 
Method: In this study we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time seires from weighted averages of past daily values of the series. This method is exponential because the value of each level is influenced by every preceeding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree  more recent values are given a greater weight. The available data is too small to identify seasonal patterns and make predictable variation in value, such as annual fluctuation in temperature relative to the season.  Trend is a tendency in the data to increase or decrease over time.
Results:

If no control measures are put in place it is expected that over 40000 would be infected in Tehran around the middle of June. However if control measures were implemented with a high degree of success one would expect the spread of the COV19 virus would peak at the start of April with a downward trend dropping off by the end of May (70 days). In the scenario that no further measures are implemented, one would expect the spread of COVID19 to continue on a gentle incline reaching 21000 by mid-June. The same process has been applied to review the confirmed deaths and recovered dataset. The forecast has been carried out for the next 30 days a shorter timeframe has been selected as there is a high probability that the Iranian New Years celebration Farvardin first month of Spring (30th March in Western calendar) will have an impact on the infection rate following the event. 

The best predictive model predicts the confirmed cases to be in the range of 35000 70000 with the number of reported COVDI-19 deaths to be between 3000  5000 and 5000  30000 of recovered cases. 

Conclusions: Modeling outbreak ofCovid19 shows that the number of patients and deaths is still increasing. Contagious diseases follow an exponential model and the same be Haves this one. This is because the virus can spread to others and finally each person turns into a carrier of the virus and transmit it to another person. Disease control depends on disconnection and social distancing. In addition many factors are effective in stopping the disease. These include citizens participation in the prevention process health education the effectiveness of instructive traditions environmental conditions and so on.</jats:p>"
medRxiv,10.1101/2020.04.02.20046375,NA,2020-04-04,Modeling the COVID-19 outbreaks and the effectiveness of the containment measures adopted across countries,"<jats:p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak, originally started in China, a global pandemic. Since then, the outbreak has indeed spread across all continents, threatening the public health of numerous countries. Although the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is relatively low when optimal level of healthcare is granted to the patients, the high percentage of severe cases developing severe pneumonia and thus requiring respiratory support is worryingly high, and could lead to a rapid saturation of Intensive Care Units (ICUs).
To overcome this risk, most countries enacted COVID-19 containment measures.

In this study, we use a Bayesian SEIR epidemiological model to perform a parametric regression over the COVID-19 outbreaks data in China, Italy, Belgium, and Spain, and estimate the effect of the containment measures on the basic reproduction ratio R_0. 

We find that the effect of these measures is detectable, but tends to be gradual, and that a progressive strengthening of these measures usually reduces the R_0 below 1, granting a decay of the outbreak. We also discuss the biases and inconsistencies present in the publicly available data on COVID-19 cases, providing an estimate for the actual number of cases in Italy on March 12, 2020. Lastly, despite the data and model's limitations, we argue that the idea of ""flattening the curve"" is likely to be unfeasible.</jats:p>"

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models.

The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R&gt;1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R&lt;1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. 

After fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran.</jats:p>"

We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world.

By the end of February 2020, the epidemic outside Hubei province in China has been well controlled, yet the next wave of transmission in other countries may have just begun. A retrospective modeling of the transmission dynamics would provide insights into the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and evaluation of the effectiveness of the strict measures that have been taken by central and local governments of China. Using a refined susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission model and a new strategy of model fitting, we were able to estimate model parameters in a dynamic manner. The resulting parameter estimation can well reflect the prevention policy scenarios. Our simulation results with different degrees of government control suggest that the strictly enforced quarantine and travel ban have significantly decreased the otherwise uncontrollable spread of the disease. Our results suggest similar measures should be considered by other countries that are of high risk of COVID-19 outbreak.</jats:p>"

This will be facilitated by improved understanding of viral dynamics within infected hosts. Here, using a mathematical model in combination with published viral load data collected from the same specimen (throat / nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal / sputum / tracheal aspirate), we compare within-host dynamics for patients infected in the current outbreak with analogous dynamics for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. Our quantitative analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics are more severe than those for mild cases of MERS-CoV, but are similar to severe cases, and that the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV infection are similar to those of MERS-CoV in mild cases but not in severe case. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 generates infection dynamics that are more severe than SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we used our viral dynamics model to predict the effectiveness of unlicensed drugs that have different methods of action. The effectiveness was measured by AUC of viral load. Our results indicated that therapies that block de novo infections or virus production are most likely to be effective if initiated before the peak viral load (which occurs around three days after symptom onset on average), but therapies that promote cytotoxicity are likely to have only limited effects. Our unique mathematical approach provides insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, which are useful for development of antiviral therapies.</jats:p>"

Healthcare workers are at increased risk to become infected because of contact to infected patients, infected co-workers and their community outside the hospital. The ideal organisational strategy to protect the healthcare workforce in a situation in which social distancing cannot be maintained at the workplace remains to be determined. In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of hospital workforce with the goal to simulate health and productivity of the workers. Therefore, deterministic models were extended to account for stochastic influences potentially occurring in rather small populations. The models were also designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce. Our studies model workforce productivity depending on the infection rate, the presence of reinfection and the efficiency of home office. As an application example, we apply our theory to the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The results of the models reveal that a desynchronization strategy in which two medical teams work alternating for 7 days reduces the infection rate of the healthcare workforce. In case of immunity to the infectious agent this affect is mainly relevant at early stages of the pandemic. This effect is independent on infection rates and increases the overall workforce productivity under certain situations.</jats:p>"

Since the reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, the model accounts for both reported and unreported cases. Also, the model allows for the time variation of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, towards its control, along the course of the epidemic evolution. An analytical exponential behaviour for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for parametric estimations employing the present direct problem model with the data from the known portion of the epidemics evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The direct-inverse problem analysis is then employed with the actual data from China, with the first half been employed for the parametric estimation and the second half for validation of the predictive capability of the proposed approach. The full dataset for China is then employed in another parameter identification, including the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals are infectious. Following this validation, the available data on reported cases in Brasil from February 15th till March 29th, 2020, is used for estimating parameters and then predict the epidemy evolution under these conditions. Finally, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at diminishing the effects of the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviours for these two parameters, usually assumed constant in epidemic evolutions without intervention. It is demonstrated that a combination of actions to affect both parameters can have a much faster and effective result in the control of the epidemy dynamics.</jats:p>"

Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in Guangzhou and elsewhere in China. Modes of contact and risk of transmission among close contacts have not been well estimated.
Methods
We included 4950 closes contacts from Guangzhou, and extracted data including modes of contact, laboratory testing, clinical characteristics of confirmed cases and source cases. We used logistic regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with infection of close contacts.
Results
Among 4950 closes contacts, the median age was 38.0 years, and males accounted for 50.2% (2484). During quarantine period, 129 cases (2.6%) were diagnosed, with 8 asymptomatic (6.2%), 49 mild (38.0%), and 5 (3.9%) severe to critical cases. The sensitivity of throat swab was 71.32% and 92.19% at first to second PCR test. Among different modes of contact, household contacts were the most dangerous in catching with infection of COVID-19, with an incidence of 10.2%. As the increase of age for close contacts and severity of source cases, the incidence of COVID-19 presented an increasing trend from 1.8% (0-17 years) to 4.2% (60 or over years), and from 0.33% for asymptomatic, 3.3% for mild, to 6.2% for severe and critical source cases, respectively. Manifestation of expectoration in source cases was also highly associated with an increased risk of infection in their close contacts (13.6%). Secondary cases were in general clinically milder and were less likely to have common symptoms than those of source cases.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections account for almost half of the confirmed cases among close contacts. The household contacts were the main transmission mode, and clinically more severe cases were more likely to pass the infection to their close contacts. Generally, the secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source cases.</jats:p>"

We analyze the contribution of  two  key  determinants  of  the  variation  in  the  observed  CFR:  the  age-structure  of  diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19  by  age  for  China,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  South  Korea,  Spain,  and  the  United  States.  We calculate the CFR for each country at the latest data point and for  Italy  also over time. We use demographic  decomposition  to  break  the  difference  between  CFRs  into  unique  contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality.  CFRs  vary  from  0.7%  in  Germany  and  1.6%  in  South  Korea  to  8.6%  in  Spain  and 10.6% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases can explain a substantial proportion of cross-country variation in the CFR. For example, 57% of Spain's difference with respect to South Korea is explained by the observed cases being older. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 10.6%  between  March  9  and  March  29,  2020,  and  more  than  95%  of  the  change  was  due  to increasing age-specific case fatality rates.

Our  findings  lend  support  to  recommendations  for  data  to  be disaggregated  by  age,  and  potentially  other  variables,  to  facilitate  a  better  understanding  of population-level differences in CFRs.

Common symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia included fever, fatigue and dry cough. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases, we have no history to learn from and no evidence to count on. Traditional models often predict inconsistent results. Aiming at estimate the epidemic trend timely after the outbreak, we mainly used 7-day moving average of log-transformed daily new cases (LMA) to establish a new index named ""epidemic trend index"", which will be used to predict the evolutionary trend of the epidemic situation and support epidemic control decision making processes. We used SARS epidemic data from Hong Kong in 2003 to verify the practicability of the new index, which shows that the index is acceptable. The epidemic trend index was then applied to the COVID-19 epidemic analysis in China. The results show that during the epidemic, the trend direction of different districts of China changed on different date. In the whole country and in Hubei Province alone, the epidemic reached the peak on February 9. While the peak appeared earlier, i.e. on February 5 in other provinces. It indicated that decisive outbreak control measures of the Chinese government are effective. While local governments should adjust management measures based on local risk level of epidemic. Although the epidemic has eased since late February, continued efforts in epidemic control are still needed to accelerate the end of the epidemic in China. However, the global COVID-19 epidemic outside China continues to expand as indicated by the epidemic trend index we proposed. In order to cope with the novel coronavirus pandemic, people all over the world should work together and governments of all countries should take efficient measures in the light of China's experience and according to national circumstances and local conditions.</jats:p>"

In-hospital mortality are high in severe cases and cardiac injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin are common among them. The mechanism of cardiac injury and the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality remained unclear. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients are scarce.
[Objectives] To investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
[Methods] Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data of consecutive confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients admitted in Wuhan No.1 Hospital from 25th December, 2019 to 15th February, 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.
[Results] A total of 110 patients with confirmed (n=80) or suspected (n=30) COVID-19 were screened and 48 patients (female 31.3%, mean age 70.58±13.38 year old) among them with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) test within 48 hours after admission were included, of whom 17 (17/48, 35.4%) died in hospital while 31 (31/48, 64.6%) were discharged or transferred to other hospital. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was levated in 13 (13/48, 27.1%) patents. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed pulse oximetry of oxygen saturation (SpO2) on admission (HR 0.704, 95% CI 0.546-0.909, per 1% decrease, p=0.007), elevated hs-cTnI (HR 10.902, 95% 1.279-92.927, p=0.029) and elevated d-dimer (HR 1.103, 95%CI 1.034-1.176, per 1mg/L increase, p=0.003) on admission were independently associated with in-hospital mortality.
[Conclusions] Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Parallel testing with approved qPCR kits of SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases confirmed that NTS identified more infected patients as positive, and could also monitor for mutated nucleic acid sequence or other respiratory virus infection in the test sample.

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.</jats:p>"

To study the neurological manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
DESIGN:
Retrospective case series
SETTING:
Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.
PARTICIPANTS:
Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists.
RESULTS:
Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ± 15.0 years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]).
CONCLUSION:
Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.</jats:p>"

We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence.
Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve.
Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age ≥ 50 and NLR &lt; 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 would develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process.
Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe illness. Patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 facilitated severe illness, and they should rapidly access to intensive care unit if necessary.</jats:p>"

The ongoing outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global threat. Clarifying its clinical features such as risk factors for disease progression is a pressing issue. We analyzed the difference between non-severe and severe cases with COVID-19 as a result of the mass infection on a cruise ship “Diamond Princess” in Japan.
Methods
In this retrospective, single-center study, total 104 cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled from the mass infection on the cruise ship from 11th to 25th Feb, 2020, at Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were collected and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until 26th Feb, 2020.
Findings
Of the 104 patients, 47 were male. The median age was 68 years. During the observation period, eight patients deteriorated into the severe cases. Finally, 76 and 28 patients were classified as non-severe (asymptomatic, mild), and severe cases, respectively. Chest CT abnormalities were found in 43 in non-severe cases and 23 in severe cases. The prevalence of consolidation on chest CT scan and lymphopenia on the admission day was significantly higher in severe cases and in the eight cases which worsened into severe disease during the observation period.
Interpretation
The high proportion of non-severe cases corrects the assessment of the trend of the outbreak. Consolidation on chest CT scan and lymphopenia were possible risk factors for deterioration of COVID-19 and contribute to the clinical management.

Healthcare authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19.
Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p&lt;0.05.
Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19.
Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs beyond borders, and further studies are warranted.</jats:p>"

Reporting delays in disease surveillance impair the ability to assess the current dynamic of an epidemic. In continuously updated epidemic curves, case numbers for the most recent epidemic week or day usually appear to be lower than the previous, suggesting a decline of the epidemic. In reality, the epidemic curve may still be on the rise, because reporting delay prevents the most recent cases to appear in the case count. In context of the COVID-19 epidemic and for countries planning large international gatherings, such as the Summer Olympic Games in Japan 2020, the ability to assess the actual stage of an epidemic is of outmost importance. 

Methods
We applied now-casting onto COVID-19 data provided by the nCoV-2019 Data Working Group to evaluate the .true count of cases, by taking into account reporting delays occurring between date of symptom onset and date of confirmation. 

Findings
We calculated a decrease of reporting delay, from a median delay of ten days in calendar week four 2020 to six days in calendar week eight, resulting in an overall mean of 4.3 days. The confidence intervals of the now-casting indicated an increase of cases in the last reporting days, while case country in that same time period suggested a decline. 

Interpretation
As a specific use case this tool may be of particular value for the challenging risk assessment and risk communication in the context of the Summer Olympic Games in Japan 2020 and similar situations elsewhere.</jats:p>"

Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis. However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients.
Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR from questionnaires and electronic medical records.
Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 ± 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5% in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection.
Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of COVID-19. Further detailed and comprehensive ophthalmological guidance is needed for COVID-19 control.</jats:p>"
medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.25.20043562,NA,2020-03-27,On the assessment of more reliable COVID-19 infected number: the italian case.,"<jats:p>COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most recent pandemic disease the world is currently managing. It started in China at the end of 2019, and it is diffusing throughout Italy, one of the most affected countries, and it is currently spreading through European countries and USA. Patients affected by COVID-19 are identified employing medical swabs applied mainly to (i) citizens with COVID-19 symptoms such as flu or high temperature, or (ii) citizens that had contacts with COVID-19 patients. A percentage of COVID-19 affected patients needs hospitalisation, whereas a portion needs to be treated in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). 
 
Nevertheless, it is a matter of current intuition that COVID-19 infected citizens are more than those detected, and sometime the infection is detected too late. Thus there are many efforts in both tracking people activities as well as diffusing low cost reliable COVID-19 tests for early detection.

Starting from mortality rates of diseases caused by viruses in the same family (e.g. MERS, SARS, H1N1), we study the relations between the number of COVID-19 infections and the number of deaths, through Italian regions. We thus assess several infections being higher than the ones currently measured.
We thus focus on the characterisation of the pandemic diffusion by estimating the infected number of patients versus the number of death.
We use such an estimated number of infections, to foresee the effects of restriction actions adopted by governments to constrain virus diffusion. 
We finally think that our model can support the healthcare system to react when COVID-19 is increasing.</jats:p>"

The possible transmission of 2019−nCoV by conjunctiva is controversial and has substantial public health implications.
Methods: A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible transmission of 2019−nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67 cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during 17−28 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019−nCoV.
Results: 63 patients were identified as laboratory−confirmed NCP and the remaining four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019−nCoV test. Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative.
Conclusion: 2019−nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP. Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission path.</jats:p>"

Highly efficient and accurate microbiological laboratory assay is essential to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection, rule out other pathogens that can cause CAP, and monitor secondary infections. Here, we enrolled and provide microbiological analysis for 129 suspected and 52 transferred confirmed NCP patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) from Jan 21 to Feb 29, 2020. By analyzing the dual swab samples (sputum and pharyngeal) from 129 suspected patients with realtime RT-PCR, we confirmed 33 SARS-CoV-2 infections, with two co-infection cases with adenovirus or rhinovirus. We also used multiplex PCR to detect 13 common respiratory tract pathogens in 96 non-NCP patients, and found that 30 patients (31.25%) were infected with at least one respiratory tract pathogen that may cause CAP. Further, we performed bacterial and fungal cultures as well as fungal serologic tests and found that there is no secondary bacterial/fungal infections in confirmed NCP patients. Our studies suggest that, during the epidemic of NCP in Anhui province, there was a certain proportion of infection and co-infection of other common pathogens of CAP, and the secondary bacterial and fungal infection is not detectable in NCP patients. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 detection alone, this optimized strategy combining multiple pathogen detection for identification of NCP and other CAP patients as well as cultures and serologic tests for confirmed patients increases the diagnosis efficiency and facilitates the personalized medication.</jats:p>"

We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS.

We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients.

During the initial phase, the number of cases doubled every 2.7 (range 2.2 - 4.4) days. The rate of increase in the number of reported cases peaked approximately 10 days after suppression measures were started on 23-25 January 2020. The peak in the number of reported sick cases occurred on average 18 days after the start of measures. From the time of starting measures till the peak, the number of cases increased by a factor 38.5 in the province Hubei, and by a factor 9.5 for all of China (range: 6.2-20.4 in the other provinces). Complete suppression took up to 2 months (range: 23-57d.), during which period severe restrictions, social distancing measures, testing and isolation of cases were in place.

Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. 
Methods: Each country's COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. 
Findings: The country-specific R revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. Outside China, R estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. GENI scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. Integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. 
Interpretation: R was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. Integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic R, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. Synergistically, GENI provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. We calculated an instantaneous country-specific R at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence.</jats:p>"

Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aOR:0.47; 95% CI:0.27 to 0.82). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents.
Conclusions The ability to adopt and comply with certain NPIs is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socio-economic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.</jats:p>"

Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak.

Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak.

Conclusion: Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust.</jats:p>"

We aim to examine adaptive immune cells in non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding. 

Methods
37 non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence transferred to Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively recruited to PP (persistently positive) group, which was further allocated to PPP group (n=19) and PPN group (n=18), according to their testing results after 7 days (N=negative). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Data from age- and sex-matched non-severe patients at disease onset (PA [positive on admission] patients, n=37), and lymphocyte subpopulation measurements from matched 54 healthy subjects were extracted for comparison. 

Results
Compared with PA patients, PP patients had much improved laboratory findings, including WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, albumin, AST, CRP, SAA, and IL-6. The absolute numbers of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells were significantly higher in PP group than that in PA group, and were comparable to that in healthy controls. PPP subgroup had markedly reduced B cells and T cells compared to PPN group and healthy subjects. Finally, paired results of these lymphocyte subpopulations from 10 PPN patients demonstrated that the number of T cells and B cells significantly increased when the SARS-CoV-2 tests turned negative. 

Conclusion 
Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence in non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced numbers of adaptive immune cells. Monitoring lymphocyte subpopulations could be clinically meaningful in identifying fully recovered COVID-19 patients.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.</jats:p>"

As of 22 March, 2020, South Korea reported 8897 confirmed cases of and 104 deaths from COVID-19.
 
Methods: We collected the number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths in South Korea from the World Health Organization (as of 21 March, 2020) and case distribution and fatality rates by age from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (as of 22 March, 2020).  We estimated population-level mortality rates by fitting a negative binomial regression model with the number of deaths as the outcome and population by age as an offset.  We then calculated the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) based on the current COVID-19 figures and for alternative scenarios of increased prevalence.

Findings:  The COVID-19 population-level mortality rate (per 100,000 person-years) increased with age: from 0.1 deaths among 30-39 year olds to 9.5 deaths among ≥80 year olds.  The ASDR (per 100,000 person-years) was 0.8 deaths.  The ASDR would increase to 52.0 deaths at a 1% prevalence (becoming the third leading cause of death) and 155.9 deaths at 3% prevalence (becoming the leading cause of death).
 
Interpretation: Currently, the population-level mortality burden of COVID-19 in South Korea, as measured by the ASDR, was relatively low compared to other causes of death partly due to the low prevalence of COVID-19.  If the prevalence increases from another outbreak, the mortality burden could increase substantially and surpass other leading causes.</jats:p>"

Overall 45.4% (95% CI 45.1-45.7) of adults reported any of the 6 comorbidities, increasing from 19.8% (19.1-20.4) for ages 18-29 years to 80.7% (79.5-81.8) for ages 80+ years.

Therefore, it makes sense to search for a potential biomarker that could rapidly and effectively identify severe cases early. Clinical samples from 28 cases of COVID-19 (8 severe cases, 20 mild cases) in Zunyi District from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were collected and otherwise statistically analysed for biochemical markers. Serum urea, creatinine (CREA) and cystatin C (CysC) concentrations in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild COVID-19 patients (P&lt;0.001), and there were also significant differences in serum direct bilirubin (DBIL), cholinesterase (CHE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients (P&lt;0.05). Serum urea, CREA, CysC, DBIL, CHE and LDH could be used to distinguish severe COVID-19 cases from mild COVID-19 cases. In particular, serum biomarkers, including urea, CREA, CysC, which reflect glomerular filtration function, may have some significance as potential indicators for the early diagnosis of severe COVID-19 and to distinguish it from mild COVID-19.

Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an escalating global epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, with a high mortality in critical patients. Effective indicators for predicting disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are urgently needed. 
Methods: In this study, 43 COVID-19 patients admitted in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center were involved. Demographic data, clinical features, and laboratory examinations were obtained through electronic medical records. Peripheral blood specimens were collected from COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets and cytokine profiles by flow cytometry. Potential contributing factors for prediction of disease severity were further analyzed.
Results: A total of 43 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, including 29 mild patients and 14 sever patients. Severe patients were significantly older (61.9+/-9.4 vs 44.4+/-15.9) and had higher incidence in co-infection with bacteria compared to mild group (85.7%vs27.6%). Significantly more severe patients had the clinical symptoms of anhelation (78.6%) and asthma (71.4%). For laboratory examination, 57.1% severe cases showed significant reduction in lymphocyte count. The levels of Interluekin-6 (IL6), IL10, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-Dimer (D-D) were significantly higher in severe patients than mild patients, while the level of albumin (ALB) was remarkably lower in severe patients. Further analysis demonstrated that ESR, D-D, age, ALB and IL6 were the major contributing factors for distinguishing severe patients from mild patients. Moreover, ESR was identified as the most powerful factor to predict disease progression of COVID-19 patients.
Conclusion: Age and the levels of ESR, D-D, ALB and IL6 are closely related to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. ESR can be used as a valuable indicator for distinguishing severe COVID-19 patients in early stage, so as to increase the survival of severe patients.

Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.</jats:p>"

There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan.
Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. 
Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P&lt;0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. 
Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus.</jats:p>"

With limited medical resources, it is a natural strategy, while adopted, to access the severity of patients then determine the treatment priority. However, our work observes the fact that the condition of many mild outpatients quickly worsens in a short time, i.e. deteriorate into severe/critical cases. Hence, it has been crucial to early identify those cases and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression. Methods: A total of 133 consecutively mild COVID-19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB-approved study. All mild patients at admission were categorized into groups with or without malignant progression. The clinical and laboratory data at admission, the first CT, and the follow-up CT at severe/critical stage of the two groups were compared with Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and t test. Both traditional logistic regression and deep learning-based methods were used to build the prediction models. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the models. Results: The deep learning-based method significantly outperformed logistic regression (AUC 0.954 vs. 0.893). The deep learning-based method achieved a prediction AUC of 0.938 by combining the clinical data and the CT data, significantly outperforming its counterpart trained with clinical data only by 0.141. By further considering the temporal information of the CT sequence, our model achieved the best AUC of 0.954. The proposed model can be effectively used for finding out the mild patients who are easy to deteriorate into severe/critical cases, so that such patients get timely treatments while alleviating the limitations of medical resources.</jats:p>"

Because the COVID-19 outbreak has made comprehensive and profound impacts on the world, an accurate prediction of its epidemic trend is significant. Although many studies have predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend, most of these studies have used the early stage data and focused on the China cases. 
Methods: We predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend in China and across the world using the machine learning approach. We first built the models for predicting the daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China based on the data from Jan 20, 2020, to Mar 1, 2020. Furthermore, we built the models, derived from the models for the China cases, for predicting the epidemic trend across the world (outside China). 
Findings: The COVID-19 outbreak will peak on Feb 22, 2020 in China and April 10, 2020 across the world. It will be basically under control early April, 2020 in China and mid-June, 2020 across the world.

Moreover, as of the 13th of March 2020, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic. Many European governments have already implemented harsh measures to attempt to contain the spread of the virus. In Portugal, there are, as of the 20th of March 2020, 1020 confirmed cases. 
One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. A timely idea of the amount of cases that will exist in a near future can allow governments and policy makers to act accordingly.
In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct two or three different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model. 
In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people by the beginning of April. If measures are appropriately taken this number can be reduced to about 800 cases. In case that some measures are taken, but their implementation is not done appropriately, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figures probably lie between the interval (~800-7,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20nd of April 2020.
Without control and self-protective measures, this model predicts that the figures of active cases of SARS-covid-2 would reach a staggering ~40,000 people It shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~800-7,000 people. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.</jats:p>"

The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019, poses a huge threat to China and even global public health security. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. 

METHODS
The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model.

Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases.

RESULTS
The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. 


CONCLUSIONS

Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.</jats:p>"

A good understanding of the dynamic of the disease would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID-19. However, to the best of our knowledge, the unique features of the outbreak have limited the applications of all existing models. In this paper, a novel stochastic model is proposed which aims to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We find that, (1) instead of aberration, there is a remarkable amount of asymptomatic individuals, (2) an individual with symptoms is approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic patient, (3) the transmission rate has reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, (4) it is expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the the selected provinces and cities.</jats:p>"

To predict the epidemic of COVID-19 based on quarantined surveillance from real world in China by modified SEIR model different from the previous simply mathematical model.
Design and Methods:
We forecasted the epidemic of COVID-19 based on current clinical and epidemiological data and built a modified SEIR model to consider both the infectivity during incubation period and the influence on the epidemic from strict quarantined measures.
Results:
The peak time of the curve for the infected newly diagnosed as COVID-19 should substantially present on Feb.5,2020(in non-Hubei areas) and Feb.19,2020(in Hubei. It is estimated that the peak of the curve of the cumulative confirmed cases will appear in non-Hubei areas on Mar.3,2020 and in Hubei province on Mar.10,2020,and the total number of the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 is 18,000 in non-Hubei areas and 78,000-96,000 in Hubei.The Chinese COVID-19 epidemic can be completely controlled in May,2020.

We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the Error Function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, i.e., to the change in sign of its second derivative (that is the change from acceleration to deceleration) as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations in the attempt to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease of the number of daily positive cases. Although, official data have been used, these predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach, since those predictions are based on statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as medical, social distancing, virologic, epidemiological, etc.) or models of contamination diffusion.</jats:p>"

The  outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to expand across the world. Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 

Methods:
In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. 

Results:
A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%).

Conclusions:
The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.</jats:p>"

Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. 
Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. 
Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.</jats:p>"

We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing.
Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups.
Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P&lt;0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.19×10^9/L (±1.47) versus 7.21×10^9/L (±2.94), P&lt;0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.39×10^9/L (±1.48) versus 5.38×10^9/L (±2.85), P&lt;0.001] in peripheral blood.

Methods: A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. We assessed depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and social support using the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) among patients at admission. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Results: Of the 144 participants, 34.72% and 28.47% patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of anxiety or depression, respectively.

A novel coronavirus (SARA-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Within a few weeks, the disease caused by SARA-CoV-2, which is named COVID-19, has escalated into an unprecedented ongoing outbreak with frightening speed, becoming a global health emergency. This study aimed to exam the prevalence and risk factors of acute posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese people shortly after the massive outbreak of COVID-19.

Method
An online anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted in mainland China between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey consisted of two self-administered questionnaires: one was designed to require personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent exposure history of Wuhan, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), which was to assess PTSS referring to the outbreak.

Results
A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSS among the public in mainland China 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p &lt; 0.001), exposure history of Wuhan (p = 0.047), classification of population (p &lt; 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p &lt; 0.001) could be regarded as predictor factors for PTSS.

Conclusions
The results showed that some Chinese showed acute PTSS during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, comprehensive psychological intervention needs further implementation. Furthermore, females, people who having recent exposure history of Wuhan, those at high risk of infection or with poor sleep quality deserve special attention.</jats:p>"

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an evolving infectious disease that dramatically spread all over the world in the early part of 2020. No studies have yet summarised the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. 
Methods:
We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We synthesised a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). 
Results:
In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 6.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4-2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%.  
Conclusion:
Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.</jats:p>"

Its fast spreading to other provinces in China and overseas is very likely causing a pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus has been reported to be capable of endangering thousands of lives, it is extremely important to find out how the coronavirus is transmitted in human organs. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV but the significance remains undetermined. The cell receptor angiotensin covering enzyme II (ACE2), which is the major receptor of SARS-nCoV, has been reported to be a cellular entry receptor of 2019-nCoV as well. Here, to more precisely explore the potential pathogen transmission route of the 2019-nCoV infections in the gastrointestinal tract, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the colon tissue of healthy adults and colorectal cancer patients of our cohort and other databases. The data indicates that ACE2 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the colon. The expression of ACE2 is gradually increased from healthy control, adenoma to colorectal cancer patients in our cohort as well as in the external Asian datasets. According to the expression profile of ACE2 in colon epithelial cells, we speculate adenoma and colorectal cancer patients are more likely to be infected with 2019-nCoV than healthy people.

Approximately 15-20% of COVID-19 patients will develop severe pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed.  
Methods 
125 COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study were classified into mild (93 cases) and severe (32 cases) groups, basing on their 3 to 7-days clinical outcomes. Patients' gender, age, comorbid with underlying diseases, epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory tests on admission were collected and subsequently analyzed with single-factor and multivariate logistic regression methods. Finally, we evaluate their prognostic values with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.
Results 
Seventeen factors on admission differed significantly between mild and severe groups. Next, only four factors, including the comorbid with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (&gt;24/min), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP &gt;10mg/liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH &gt;250U/liter), were found to be independently associated with the later disease development. Prognostic value analysis by ROC indicated that individual factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia, but that the combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH significantly increase the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity= 0.941, and specificity= 0.902). Three- or four-factors combinations, including elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, further increased the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA post-admission could independently predict the severe illness occurrence.
Conclusions 
General clinical characteristics and laboratory tests, such as combinations consisting of elevated LDH and fast respiratory rate, and detectable viral RNA in serum post-admission could provide high confident prognostic value for identifying potential severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.</jats:p>"

Methods Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19.
Results Out of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly higher white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and lower red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all p&lt;0.05). With a cut-off value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 77.6%, positive predictive value 61.3%, and negative predictive value 95.4%.

CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p&lt;0.001).
Conclusions In patients with COVID-19, admission CRP correlated with disease severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse outcome.</jats:p>"

medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.26.20044214,NA,2020-03-30,Projecting the Spread of COVID19 for Germany,"<jats:p>We model the evolution of the number of individuals that are reported to be sick with COVID-19 in Germany. Our theoretical framework builds on a continuous time Markov chain with four states: healthy without infection, sick, healthy after recovery or after infection but without symptoms and dead. Our quantitative solution matches the number of sick individuals up to the most recent observation and ends with a share of sick individuals following from infection rates and sickness probabilities. We employ this framework to study inter alia the expected peak of the number of sick individuals in a scenario without public regulation of social contacts. We also study the effects of public regulations. For all scenarios we report the expected end of the CoV-2 epidemic.

We have four general findings: First, current epidemiological thinking implies that the long-run effects of the epidemic only depend on the aggregate long-run infection rate and on the individual risk to turn sick after an infection. Any measures by individuals and the public therefore only influence the dynamics of spread of CoV-2. Second, predictions about the duration and level of the epidemic must strongly distinguish between the officially reported numbers (Robert Koch Institut, RKI) and actual numbers of sick individuals. Third, given the current (scarce) medical knowledge about long-run infection rate and individual risks to turn sick, any prediction on the length (duration in months) and strength (e.g. maximum numbers of sick individuals on a given day) is subject to a lot of uncertainty. Our predictions therefore offer robustness analyses that provide ranges on how long the epidemic will last and how strong it will be. Fourth, public interventions that are already in place and that are being discussed can lead to more and less severe outcomes of the epidemic. If an intervention takes place too early, the epidemic can actually be stronger than with an intervention that starts later. Interventions should therefore be contingent on current infection rates in regions or countries.

Concerning predictions about COVID-19 in Germany, we find that the long-run number of sick individuals (that are reported to the RKI), once the epidemic is over, will lie between 500 thousand and 5 million individuals. While this seems to be an absurdly large range for a precise projection, this reflects the uncertainty about the long-run infection rate in Germany. If we assume that Germany will follow the good scenario of Hubei (and we are even a bit more conservative given discussions about data quality), we will end up with 500 thousand sick individuals over the entire epidemic. If by contrast we believe (as many argue) that once the epidemic is over 70% of the population will have been infected (and thereby immune), we will end up at 5 million cases.

Defining the end of the epidemic by less than 100 newly reported sick individuals per day, we find a large variation depending on the effectiveness of governmental pleas and regulations to reduce social contacts. An epidemic that is not influenced by public health measures would end mid June 2020. With public health measures lasting for few weeks, the end is delayed by around one month or two. The advantage of the delay, however, is to reduce the peak number of individuals that are simultaneously sick. When we believe in long-run infection rates of 70%, this number is equally high for all scenarios we went through and well above 1 million. When we can hope for the Hubei-scenario, the maximum number of sick individuals will be around 200 thousand only.

Whatever value of the range of long-run infection rates we want to assume, the epidemic will last at least until June, with extensive and potentially future public health measures, it will last until July. In the worst case, it will last until end of August.

We emphasize that all projections are subject to uncertainty and permanent monitoring of observed incidences are taken into account to update the projection. The most recent projections are available at https://www.macro.economics.uni-mainz.de/corona-blog/.</jats:p>"

We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025.

Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. 
Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens.
Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (&gt;4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind).
Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.</jats:p>"

The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. 
Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery.

Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi an, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending. Recruitment is expected to start in March 2020.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) due to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment.
Methods and analysis. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more than 24 hours. The primary outcome evaluates levels of oxygenation between the two groups at 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include rate of survival rate at 28 and 90 days in the two groups, time to resolution of severe hypoxemia, time to achieve negativity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests.

This study is aimed to investigate the risk perception and immediate psychological state of HCWs in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. 
Methods This study utilized a cross-sectional survey designed on a convenient sample of 4357 HCWs in China. Its data were collected using anonymous structured questionnaires distributed through social software. 6 questions were set to evaluate the participants' risk perception of COVID-19, and a General Health Questionnaire was used to identify the participants' immediate psychological status. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Risk perception and psychological status were compared by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 exposure experiences.
Result A total of 4,600 questionnaires were distributed, and 4,357 qualified ones (94.7%) were collected. The main concerns of HCWs are: infection of colleagues (72.5%), infection of family members (63.9%), protective measures (52.3%) and medical violence (48.5%). And 39.1% of the HCWs had psychological distress, especially working in Wuhan, participating in frontline treatments, having been isolated and having family members or colleagues infected.
Conclusions The finding indicating that, faced with the COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs, especially in Wuhan, were worried about the risks of infection and protective measures, resulting in psychological distress, so further actions should be taken.</jats:p>"

Design: Cross sectional population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 February, 2020
Setting: Wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and Shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with Wuhan)
Participants: Random sample of 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai aged above 18
Main outcome measures: Anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [GAD-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out).
Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score ≥10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p&lt;0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7).

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we aimed to investigate behavioural change on exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak, and public support and confidence for governmental containment measures.
Methods
A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities.
Findings 
Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p&lt;0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p&lt;0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p&lt;0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p&lt;0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P&lt;0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures.
Interpretation 
The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.</jats:p>"

Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore′s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% -  67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.</jats:p>"

We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people. By targeting recommendations to only those at risk, epidemics could be contained without need for mass quarantines ('lock-downs') that are harmful to society.

To mitigate and slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have adopted unprecedented physical distancing policies, including the UK. We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case).

Methods: 
We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire documents the age and location of contacts and as well as a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday 24th March, one day after a “lockdown” was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the lockdown to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place.

Findings: 
We found a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.2 to 2.9). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37 - 0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22 - 0.53) for physical contacts only.


Interpretation:

The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.</jats:p>"

Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases as of March 21, 2020.

An open-label clinical trial has just concluded, suggesting improved resolution of viremia with use of two existing therapies: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as monotherapy, and in combination with azithromycin (HCQ-AZ).

The results of this important trial have major implications for global policy in the rapid scale-up and response to this pandemic. The authors present results with p-values for differences in proportions between the study arms, but their analysis is not able to provide effect size estimates.

To address this gap, more modern analytical methods including survival models, have been applied to these data, and show modest to no impact of HCQ treatment, with more significant effects from the HCQ-AZ combination, potentially suggesting a role for co-infections in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

The trial of Gautret and colleagues, with consideration of the effect sizes, and p-values from multiple models, does not provide sufficient evidence to support wide-scale rollout of HCQ monotherapy for the treatment of COVID-19; larger randomzied studies should be considered. However, these data do suggest further study of HCQ-AZ combination therapy should be prioritized as rapidly as possible.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to assess the disease status of IBD patients in Hubei province by questionnaire online and guide to the self-management of IBD patients during this epidemic.
Methods: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the Partial Mayo Score (PMS), the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within one month of traffic control after the outbreak of COVID-19. This questionnaire also included some questions about patients' self-report disease conditions and their epidemiological history of COVID-19.
Results: A total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included in the analysis. No patient reported infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in our study. Our result showed that 69.64% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.44% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were in remission. There was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of the active disease stage between the two types of disease (p=0.103). The majority of patients (85.29%) had a good health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (SIBDQ≥50). The reduction in physical exercise is a risk factor for worsening in conditions (OR=17.593, 95%CI 2.035 to 152.097, p=0.009).
Conclusions: The outbreak of COVID-19 might not have a significant impact on most Hubei IBD patients within one month after the traffic control. The patient's disease condition could be assessed by our questionnaires. Doctors utilized the information and advised for IBD patients about self-management during the period of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Older age and elevated d-dimer are reported risk factors for Covid-19. However, whether early radiographic change is a predictor of fatality remains unknown. We retrospectively reviewed records of all laboratory-confirmed patients admitted to a quarantine unit at Tongji Hospital, a large regional hospital in Wuhan, China, between January 31 and March 5, 2020. The Tongji Hospital ethics committee approved this study. A total of 128 patients were admitted. 102 patients were confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using RNA detection. As of March 20, 82 confirmed patients were discharged, 15 died, and 5 remained hospitalized. The median age was 57 years (range, 27 - 85), 59 (58%) were male, and 44 (43%) patients had a comorbidity. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. When compared with survivors, non-survivors were older and more likely to have lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated d-dimer, and increased hypersensitive troponin I. In a multivariate regression model that included these predictors, older age and elevated LDH were independent risk factors for fatality. Twenty-one survivors and 11 non-survivors had CT scans within the first week. We used severity score to quantify the extent of lung opacification as described in the Supplementary Appendix. The total severity score and number of involved lung lobes within the first week were significantly greater in non-survivors compared to survivors . Using univariate logistic regression analysis, higher total severity score (≥15) (odds ratio 53, 95% CI 3-369; p = 0.003), and more involved lung lobes (5 involved lobes) (9, 2-53; p = 0.016) in CT images within the first week were significantly associated with fatality. Moreover, in this subset of patients with CT data within the first week, higher total severity score was the only independent risk factor in a multivariate analysis incorporated the predictors discussed above (older age, lymphocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated d-dimer, and increased troponin I). For survivors with serial CT scans performed over four weeks, total severity score peaked in the second week.

SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus  broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.</jats:p>"

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes.

However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now.

In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods.

Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models on the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.</jats:p>"

This highlights the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. In Singapore, four major COVID-19 case clusters have emerged thus far. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0 around February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent estimate of Rt is at 0.9 (95% CI: 0.7,1.0) while an estimate of the overall R based on cluster size distribution is at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0). The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscore the significant effects of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.</jats:p>"

Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) and 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.3) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the results, we note that current 2019-nCoV epidemic has a substation potential to cause a pandemic.

As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro -- the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate $r$, the mean generation interval $\bar G$, and the generation-interval dispersion $\kappa$.
We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate Ro at the outset of an epidemic.</jats:p>"

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear.
METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. 
RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (≥60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, or 400/μL, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. 
CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, and 400/μL, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.</jats:p>"

This is the first observation of an association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that this is an early study with limitations.

The authors report that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had significant virus reducing effects, and that dual treatment of both HCQ and azithromycin further enhanced virus reduction. This data has triggered speculation whether these drugs should be considered as candidates for the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, questions have been raised regarding the study's data integrity, statistical analyses, and experimental design. We therefore reanalysed the original data to interrogate the main claims of the paper. Here we apply Bayesian statistics to assess the robustness of the original papers claims by testing four variants of the data: 1) The original data; 2) Data including patients who deteriorated; 3) Data including patients who deteriorated with exclusion of untested patients in the comparison group; 4) Data that includes patients who deteriorated with the assumption that untested patients were negative. To ask if HCQ monotherapy is effective, we performed an A/B test for a model which assumes a positive effect, compared to a model of no effect. We find that the statistical evidence is highly sensitive to these data variants. Statistical evidence for the positive effect model ranged from strong for the original data (BF ~11), to moderate when including patients who deteriorated (BF ~4.35), to anecdotal when excluding untested patients (BF ~2), and to anecdotal negative evidence if untested patients were assumed positive (BF ~0.6). To assess whether HCQ is more effective when combined with AZ, we performed the same tests, and found only anecdotal evidence for the positive effect model for the original data (BF ~2.8), and moderate evidence for all other variants of the data (BF ~5.6). Our analyses only explore the effects of different assumptions about excluded and untested patients. These assumptions are not adequately reported, nor are they justified in the original paper, and we find that varying them causes substantive changes to the evidential support for the main claims of the original paper. This statistical uncertainty is exacerbated by the fact that the treatments were not randomised, and subject to several confounding variables including the patients' consent to treatment, different care centres, and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, while the viral load measurements were noisy, showing multiple reversals between test outcomes, there is greater certainty around other clinical outcomes such as the 4 patients who seriously deteriorated. The fact that all of these belonged to the HCQ monotherapy group should be assigned greater weight when evaluating the potential clinical efficacy of HCQ. Randomised controlled trials are currently underway, and will be critical in resolving this uncertainty as to whether HCQ and AZ are effective as a treatment for COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Palliative care is an essential component of healthcare in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, psychological support, and supporting triage and complex decision making. 

Aim
To examine preparedness for, and impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic on hospices in Italy to inform the response in other countries.

Design
Cross-sectional telephone survey, carried out in March 2020.

Setting
Sixteen Italian hospices, purposively sampled according to COVID-19 risk into high (more than 25 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), medium (15-25 cases per 100,000), and low risk (fewer than 15 cases per 100,000) regions. A brief questionnaire was developed to guide the interviews. Descriptive analysis was undertaken.

Results
Seven high risk, five medium risk and four low risk hospices provided data. Two high risk hospices had experienced COVID-19 cases among both patients and staff. All hospices had implemented policy changes, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice including transfer of staff from inpatient to community settings, change in admission criteria, and daily telephone support for families. Concerns included scarcity of personal protective equipment, a lack of hospice-specific guidance on COVID-19, anxiety about needing to care for children and other relatives, and poor integration of palliative care in the acute setting. 

Conclusion
The hospice sector is capable of responding flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Governments must urgently recognise the essential contribution of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensure these services are integrated into the health care system response. Availability of personal protective equipment and setting-specific guidance is essential.</jats:p>"

Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection.

Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. 

Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. 

Finding According to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th, 2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number R_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas R_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. 

Interpretation Our model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Our study, which simulated the epidemic in Wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations.</jats:p>"

Rapid and precise diagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19, providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled with nanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfully established for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment (such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63 C) for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified and detected in a one-step and single-tube reaction, and the detection results were easily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swab samples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinical samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from sample collection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, the RT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2 infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially for resource-challenged regions.</jats:p>"

We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: 
(i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas;
(ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions,  and the efficacy of entry screening at destination;
(iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia and Europe, and we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.</jats:p>"

Management of high mortality risk due to significant progression requires prior assessment of time-to-progression. However, few related methods are available for COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods:
We retrospectively enrolled 338 adult patients admitted to one hospital between Jan 11, 2020 to Feb 29, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 8, 2020. We compared characteristics between patients with severe and non-severe outcome, and used multivariate survival analyses to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions.

Results:
A total of 76 (31.9%) patients progressed to severe conditions and 3 (0.9%) died. The mean time from hospital admission to severity onset is 3.7 days. Age, body mass index (BMI), fever symptom on admission, co-existing hypertension or diabetes are associated with severe progression. Compared to non-severe group, the severe group already demonstrated, at an early stage, abnormalities in biomarkers indicating organ function, inflammatory responses, blood oxygen and coagulation function. The cohort is characterized with increasing cumulative incidences of severe progression up to 10 days after admission. Competing risks survival model incorporating CT imaging and baseline information showed an improved performance for predicting severity onset (mean time-dependent AUC = 0.880). 

Conclusions:
Multiple predisposition factors can be utilized to assess the risk of progression to severe conditions at an early stage. Multivariate survival models can reasonably analyze the progression risk based on early-stage CT images that would otherwise be misjudged by artificial analysis.</jats:p>"

(COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China and has swiftly spread to other parts of China and a number of oversea countries. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model.
Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province.
Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020.
Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.</jats:p>"

With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk
factors associated with clinical outcomes.

Methods
A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was
conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and
critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as
favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic
regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank
test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.

Results
Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the
study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with
clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking,
critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (&gt;0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (&gt;10 x 109/L) and neutrophilia (&gt;75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary
treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive
troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide
early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

At present, we don't have specific medicines or vaccines against novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and our assessment of risk factors for patients with severe pneumonia was limited. In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible.
Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic data bases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, and Web of science. The American agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0.
Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin, etc.

Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19.
Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed.
Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP ≥20 mg/L and lymphocyte count&lt; 1.1*10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury.

China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused.
Methods and findings
We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%.
Conclusions
The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.</jats:p>"

By January 2020, the potential risks imposed by 2019-nCoV in human health and economical activity were promptly highlighted. Considerable efforts have been devoted for understanding the transmission mechanisms aimed to pursue public policies oriented to mitigate the number of infected and deaths. An important question requiring some attention is the role of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and humidity) in the 2019-nCoV transmission. Correlations between meteorological temperature and relative humidity with the number of daily confirmed cases were explored in this work for the epicenter city of Wuhan, China for the period from 29 January to March 6, 2020. Long-term trend of temperature and relative humidity was obtained with a 14-days adjacent-averaging filter, and lagged correlations of the number of daily confirmed cases were explored. The analysis showed negative correlations between temperatures with the number of daily confirmed cases. Maximum correlations were found for 6-day lagged temperatures, which is likely reflecting the incubation period of the virus. It was postulated that the indoor crowding effect is responsible of the high incidence of 2019-nCoV cases, where low absolute humidity and close human contact facilitate the transport of aerosol droplets.</jats:p>"

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak.
In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05.
Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.</jats:p>"

Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>&gt;0.6) with the real data.

However, inaccurate test results (for example, high false negative rate and some false positive rate) were reported in both China and US CDC using the RT-PCR method. Inaccurate results are caused by inadequate detection sensitivity of RT-PCR, low viral load in some patients, difficulty to collect samples from COVID-19 patients, insufficient sample loading during RT-PCR tests, and RNA degradation during sample handling process. False negative detection could subject patients to multiple tests before diagnosis can be made, which burdens health care system. Delayed diagnosis could cause infected patients to miss the best treatment time window. False negative detection could also lead to prematurely releasing infected patients who still carry residual SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this case, these patients could infect many others. A high sensitivity RNA detection method to resolve the existing issues of RT-PCR is in need for more accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.
Methods: Digital PCR (dPCR) instrument DropX-2000 and assay kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 108 clinical specimens from 36 patients including pharyngeal swab, stool and blood from different days during hospitalization. Double-blinded experiment data of 108 clinical specimens by dPCR methods were compared with results from officially approved RT-PCR assay. A total of 109 samples including 108 clinical specimens and 1 negative control sample were tested in this study. All of 109 samples, 26 were from 21patients reported as positive by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection in local CDC and then hospitalized in Nantong Third Hospital. Among the 109 samples, dPCR detected 30 positive samples on ORFA1ab gene, 47 samples with N gene positive, and 30 samples with double positive on ORFA1ab and N genes.
Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimize dPCR is at least 10-fold lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of dPCR for clinical detection is 96.3%. 4 out 4 of (100 %) negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were positive judged by dPCR based on the follow-up investigation. 2 of 2 samples in the RT-PCR grey area (Ct value &gt; 37) were confirmed by dPCR with positive results. 1 patient being tested positive by RT-PCR was confirmed to be negative by dPCR. The dPCR results show clear viral loading decrease in 12 patients as treatment proceed, which can be a useful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment.
Conclusions: Digital PCR shows improved lower limit of detection, sensitivity and accuracy, enabling COVID-19 detection with less false negative and false positive results comparing with RT-PCR, especially for the tests with low viral load specimens. We showed evidences that dPCR is powerful in detecting asymptomatic patients and suspected patients. Digital PCR is capable of checking the negative results caused by insufficient sample loading by quantifying internal reference gene from human RNA in the PCR reactions. Multi-channel fluorescence dPCR system (FAM/HEX/CY5/ROX) is able to detect more target genes in a single multiplex assay, providing quantitative count of viral load in specimens, which is a powerful tool for monitoring COVID-19 treatment.</jats:p>"

Background Whether the patients with COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute renal function damage is a problem worthy of clinical attention. This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients.

Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR.

Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19. Beside the treatment of COVID-19, CRRT was also applied three times weekly.

HCWs who suffered from fever or respiratory symptoms were voluntarily tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19.

<jats:bold>Findings</jats:bold>
Thirteen-hundred fifty-three (14%) of 9,705 HCWs employed were tested, 86 (6%) of whom were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Most HCWs suffered from relatively mild disease and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Seventy-nine (92%) HCWs met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. None of the HCWs identified through the screening reported a travel history to China or Northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported to have been exposed to an inpatient known with COVID-19 prior to the onset of symptoms.

<jats:bold>Interpretation</jats:bold>
Within two weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with SARS-CoV-2, probably caused by acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, asks for less stringent use of the currently recommended case-definition for suspected COVID-19.</jats:p>"

There had been a preliminary occurrence of human-to-human transmissions between healthcare workers (HCWs), but risk factors in the susceptibility for COVID-19, and infection patterns among HCWs have largely remained unknown.

Methods
Retrospective data collection on demographics, lifestyles, contact status with infected subjects for 118 HCWs (include 12 COVID-19 HCWs) from a single-center. Sleep quality and working pressure were evaluated by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and The Nurse Stress Index (NSI), respectively. Follow-up duration was from Dec 25, 2019, to Feb 15, 2020. Risk factors and transmission models of COVID-19 among HCWs were analyzed and constructed.

Findings
A high proportion of COVID-19 HCWs had engaged in night shift-work (75.0% vs. 40.6%) and felt they were working under pressure (66.7% vs. 32.1%) than uninfected HCWs. COVID-19 HCWs had higher total scores of PSQI and NSI than uninfected HCWs. Furthermore, these scores were both positively associated with COVID-19 risk. An individual-based model (IBM) estimated the outbreak duration among HCWs in a non-typical COVID-19 ward at 62-80 days and the basic reproduction number   =1.27 [1.06, 1.61]. By reducing the average contact rate per HCW by a 1.35 factor and susceptibility by a 1.40 factor, we can avoid an outbreak of the basic case among HCWs. 

Interpretation 
Poor sleep quality and high working pressure were positively associated with high risks of COVID-19. A novel IBM of COVID-19 transmission is suitable for simulating different outbreak patterns in a hospital setting.</jats:p>"

Whereas molecular diagnostic tests were rapidly developed, serologic assays are still lacking, yet urgently needed. Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike- and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies.</jats:p>"

This new type of pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive.  This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</jats:p>"

Finally, we fit an SIR-X model to the experimental data and estimate the effect of containment policies in comparison to their effect in China.

Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
Setting: A 1,200 bed tertiary care teaching hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.
Participants: 802 adults presenting to hospital with concerns of having COVID-19, 1,246 inpatients and 2,531 hospital visitors.  
Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols.
Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital lab using RT PCR. Forty-five of these 73 people were subsequently excluded based on one negative RT PCR result plus positive results to quick screening tests for flu or other respiratory viruses. The remaining 28 people received a second RT PCR test 24 h later. Three people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 people were excluded based on two consecutive negative tests. The three COVID-19 confirmed cases received non-critical care. There were no new infections of medical staff or new infections of other hospital inpatients.
Conclusions: All three cases were detected as a result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors. Whilst screening out-patients presenting to a fever clinic remains important, monitoring visitors must not be overlooked.</jats:p>"

According to WHO reports, COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Analysis of this disease requires major attention by the Government to take necessary steps in reducing the effect of this global pandemic. In this study, outbreak of this disease has been analysed for India till 30th March 2020 and predictions have been made for the number of cases for the next 2 weeks. SEIR model and Regression model have been used for predictions based on the data collected from John Hopkins University repository in the time period of 30th January 2020 to 30th March 2020. The performance of the models was evaluated using RMSLE and achieved 1.52 for SEIR model and 1.75 for the regression model. The RMSLE error rate between SEIR model and Regression model was found to be 2.01. Also, the value of R0 which is the spread of the disease was calculated to be 2.02. Expected cases may rise between 5000-6000 in the next two weeks of time. This study will help the Government and doctors in preparing their plans for the next two weeks.

Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of March 16, 2020. Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections.
We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total number of incident SARS- CoV-2 infections in the United States on March 1, 2020, and to forecast subsequent infections potentially undetected by current testing strategies. Our analysis and forecasting estimates a total of 54,100 SARS-CoV-2 infections (80 % CI 5,600 to 125,300) have occurred in the United States to March 12, 2020.

Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase.
Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9).
Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias.</jats:p>"

The serology characteristics and complement diagnosis value of antibody test to RNA test needs to be demonstrated.
Method A patient cohort study was conducted at the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang University, China. Serial sera of COVID-19 patients were collected and total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 were detected. The antibody dynamics during the infection were described.
Results The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was 98.8% (79/80), 93.8% (75/80) and 93.8% (75/80), respectively. The first detectible serology marker is total antibody and followed by IgM and IgG, with a median seroconversion time of 15, 18 and 20 day post exposure (d.p.e) or 9, 10 and 12 days post onset, separately. The antibody levels increased rapidly since 6 d.p.o and accompanied with the decline of viral load. For patients in the early stage of illness (0-7d.p.o),Ab showed the highest sensitivity (64.1%) compared to the IgM and IgG (33.3% for both, p&lt;0.001). The sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG detection increased to 100%, 96.7% and 93.3% two weeks later, respectively.
Conclusions Typical acute antibody response is induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serology testing provides important complementation to RNA test for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patient. It should be strongly recommended to apply well-validated antibody tests in the clinical management and public health practice to improve the control of COVID-19 infection.</jats:p>"

We investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the first national occurrence of the disease. After the confirmation of the first imported cases, the lack of a proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly proportional to the amount of flights reaching each city, following first
occurrence of the virus coming from abroad.
Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were demes connected by the number of flights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in remote places of the Amazon region.
Results. The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions. We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of high poverty.</jats:p>"

We sequentially estimated sets of model parameters (maximum number of cases K, growth rate r, and half-time t0) and the epidemic ""end time"" t95 (defined as the time when the number of cases, predicted or actual, reached 95% of the maximum). The estimates of these parameters were done for sequences of reported cases growing daily (back-casting for China and forecasting for the US).  In both countries, the estimates of K grew very much in time during the exponential and nearly exponential phases making longer term forecasting not reliable. For the US, the current estimate of the maximum number of cases K is about 265,000 but it is very likely that it will grow in the future.

The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.</jats:p>"

Understanding the state of the disease and planning for future trajectories relies heavily on data on the spread and mortality. Yet official data coming from various countries are highly unreliable: symptoms similar to common cold in majority of cases and limited screening resources and delayed testing procedures may contribute to under-estimation of the burden of disease. Anecdotal and more limited data are available, but few have systematically combined those with official statistics into a coherent view of the epidemic. This study is a modeling-in-real-time of the emerging outbreak for understanding the state of the disease. Our focus is on the case of the spread of disease in Iran, as one of the epicenters of the disease in the first months of 2020.

Method: We develop a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on existing data. Building on the generic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered) framework we incorporate two behavioral and logistical considerations. First we capture the endogenous changes in contact rate (average contact per person) as more death are reported. As a result the reproduction number changes endogenously in the model. Second we differentiate reported and true cases by including simple formulations for how only a fraction of cases might be diagnosed, and how that fraction changes in response to epidemic's progression. In estimating the model we use both the official data as well as the discovered infected travelers and unofficial medical community estimates and triangulate these sources to build a more complete picture. Calibration is completed by forming a likelihood function for observing the actual time series data conditional on model parameters, and conducting a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The model is used to estimate current ""true"" cases of infection and death. We analyze the future trajectory of the disease under six conditions related to the seasonal effects and policy measures targeting social distancing. 

Findings: The model closely replicates the past data but also shows the true number of cases is likely far larger. We estimate about 493,000 current infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Our estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K). These numbers are significantly (more than one order of magnitude) higher than official statistics. The trajectory of the epidemic until the end of June could take various paths depending on the impact of seasonality and policies targeting social distancing. In the most optimistic scenario for seasonal effects, depending on policy measures, 1.6 million Iranians (90% CI: 0.9M-2.6M) are likely to get infected, and death toll will reach about 58,000 cases (90% CI: 32K-97K), while in the more pessimistic scenarios, death toll may exceed 103,000 cases (90% CI: 56K-172K).     

Implication: Our results suggest that the number of cases and deaths may be over an order of magnitude larger than official statistics in Iran. Absent extended testing capacity other countries may face a significant under-count of existing cases and thus be caught off guard about the actual toll of the epidemic.</jats:p>"

Recent studies have found that the pathogen of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, shares the same cell receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) with SARS-CoV. The pathological investigation of COVID-19 death showed that the lung had the characteristics of pulmonary fibrosis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads from the lungs to other organs has not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell-type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy and fibrotic lungs, as well as in normal and failed adult human hearts, using published single-cell RNA-seq data. We found that ACE2 expression in fibrotic lungs mainly locates in arterial vascular cells, which might provide the route for bloodstream spreading of SARS-CoV-2. The failed human hearts have a higher percentage of ACE2-expressing cardiomyocytes, and SARS-CoV-2 might attack cardiomyocytes through the bloodstream in patients with heart failure.
Moreover, ACE2 was highly expressed in cells infected by RSV or MERS-CoV and in mice treated by LPS. Our findings indicate that patients with pulmonary fibrosis, heart failure, and virus infection have a higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 might attack other organs by getting into the bloodstream. This work provides new insights into SARS-CoV-2 blood entry and heart injury and might propose a therapeutic strategy to prevent patients from developing severe complications.</jats:p>"

The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells.

Seasonal variation in transmission will facilitate epidemic control during the summer months but could lead to an intense resurgence in the autumn. Intermittent distancing measures can maintain control of the epidemic, but without other interventions, these measures may be necessary into 2022.

Method: We manually retrieved the daily cumulative numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 stratified by region in Italy from March 2, 2020 to March 28, 2020. We estimated both the crude and time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio across five geographic regions of Italy: Northwest, Northeast, Center, South and Island.

Results: The Northwest that includes Lombardy exhibited the highest time-delay-adjusted CFR at 31.4%% [95% credible interval: 30.8, 32.1%] followed by the Northeast (20.3%) [95% CrI: 19.4, 21.1], the Center region (16.5%) [95% CrI: 15.4, 17.7] and the South region (16.8%) [95% CrI: 15.0, 18.7]. The Island region has exhibited the lowest CFR (11.8%) [95% CrI: 9.0, 14.8]. 

Conclusion: Italy is experiencing one of the highest CFR from the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. Time delay adjusted CFR in all the regions in Italy except the Island region were higher than that estimated for Wuhan, China. The CFR in Northwest Italy is 2.5-fold higher than that in Wuhan. Our finding reflects the need of urgent medical support in the Northwest region and the appropriate planning and supplies procurement in other regions of Italy with focus on medical care delivery to those who are at the highest risk of poorer outcomes due to COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading throughout China and other countries including South Korea. As of March 12, 2020, a total number of 7,869 cases and 66 deaths had been documented in South Korea. Although the first confirmed case in South Korea was identified on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases showed a rapid growth on February 19, 2020 with a total number of 1,261 cases with 12 deaths based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). 

Method
Using the data of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea that are publicly available from the KCDC, this paper aims to create spatial visualizations of COVID-19 transmission between January 20, 2020 and February 19, 2020. 

Results
Using spatial visualization, this paper identified two early transmission clusters in South Korea (Daegu cluster and capital area cluster). Using a degree-weighted centrality measure, this paper proposes potential super-spreaders of the virus in the visualized clusters.

The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming.  We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios.  The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.</jats:p>"

Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a Lévy flight which is characteristic of human mobility and thus could be controlled by efficient quarantines. Since quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight can be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Our results suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is close to constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays  approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most Chinese cities control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less control.</jats:p>"

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China.

METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. 

RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6311, p&lt;0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6358, p&lt;0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p&lt;0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p&lt;0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p&lt;0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p&lt;0.01) among the confirmed cases.

CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.</jats:p>"

Using data on local transmissions until the 23rd of March 2020, we develop an ensemble of 200 ecological niche models to project monthly variation in climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout a typical climatological year. Although cases of COVID-19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cool and dry areas. The predecessor SARS-CoV-1 was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks could be expected. According to the models, temperate warm and cold climates are more favorable to spread of the virus, whereas arid and tropical climates are less favorable. However, model uncertainties are still high across much of sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia. While models of epidemic spread utilize human demography and mobility as predictors, climate can also help constrain the virus. This is because the environment can mediate human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and unsuitable climates can cause the virus to destabilize quickly, hence reducing its capacity to become epidemic.</jats:p>"

Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated.
Objective: To estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs.
Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey.  
Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. 
Participants: The number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city.  
Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan.

The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented.
      
Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time.

Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989.  

Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted.
 
Conclusions. Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models.</jats:p>"

The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.</jats:p>"

The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in the city of Wuhan, China, with a period of rapid initial spread. Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China.
Methods
In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions.
Findings
We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days.  For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low.
Interpretation
COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low. The COVID-19 epidemic should be controllable with appropriate interventions.

The study enrolled 110 patients, comprising 88 COVID-19 patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR, and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients.
Conclusions:
The study indicates significantly different clinical features between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-caused and non-2019-nCoV-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. Notably, correlation analysis demonstrates that tissue damage in COVID-19 patients is attributed to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses (""cytokine storm""). These findings provide new insights for developing efficient therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection.</jats:p>"

To reconstruct the transmission trajectory of SARS-COV-2 and analyze the effects of control measures in China.
Methods
Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas.
Results
Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073, 21342 and 13384 infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively, and there would be 2179, 633 and 107 death in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively.
Conclusion
A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic will end in early April.</jats:p>"

Estimation of the fraction and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection.  
Methods
Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness.  
Results
We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably.
Conclusions
A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.</jats:p>"
medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.26.20044677,NA,2020-03-30,Suppression and Mitigation Strategies for Control of COVID-19 in New Zealand,"<jats:p>A standard SEIR-type compartment model, parameterised for New Zealand, was used to simulate the spread of Covid19 in New Zealand and to test the effectiveness of various control strategies. Control aims can be broadly categorised as either suppression or mitigation. Suppression aims to keep cases to an absolute minimum for as long as possible. Mitigation aims to allow a controlled outbreak to occur, with the aim of preventing significant overloads on healthcare systems and gradually allowing the population to develop herd immunity. 
Both types of strategy are fraught with uncertainty. Suppression strategies can succeed in delaying an outbreak, but only for as long as such control measures can be sustained. Once controls are eased or restricted, an epidemic is likely to follow as no herd immunity has been acquired. The success or failure of mitigation strategies can depend sensitively on the timing and efficacy of control measures, and require the ability to bring rapidly growing outbreaks under immediate control when needed. This is as yet untested even for a combination of national interventions including case isolation, household quarantine, population-wide social distancing and closure of schools and universities. 
Although there are disadvantages to both types of approach, suppression has the advantage of buying time until a vaccine and/or treatment become available and allowing NZ to learn from rapidly unfolding events in other countries. A combination of successful suppression, strong border measures, and widespread contact tracing and testing resulting in containment could allow periods when control measures can be relaxed, but only if cases are reduced to a handful.</jats:p>"
medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.26.20044750,NA,2020-03-30,Symptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19,"<jats:p>Background: Controlling the transmission of respiratory infections such as influenza and COVID-19 is a critical public health priority. Non-pharmaceutical intervention policies such as community quarantines, closures and travel bans are often implemented in emergencies but many of them are disruptive and difficult to maintain for extended periods of time. A promising alternative recommended by the CDC for influenza is requiring individuals showing fever symptoms to remain isolated at home until they are fever-free for at least one day, but there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of such symptom-based isolation policies.

Methods: Here we introduce a computational model of symptom-based isolation that accounts for the timing of symptoms, viral shedding and the population structure. It was validated on outbreaks of influenza in schools and modified to account for COVID-19. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the attack rates (the proportion of the population infected) under one or more days of fever-based isolation.

Results: Using the model we find evidence that symptom-based isolation policies could reduce the attack rates of both influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks, and flatten the outbreak curves.  Specifically, we found that across a range of influenza scenarios, a CDC-recommended policy of one day isolation following fever can reduce the attack rate from 27% of the population to 12%, and to 3% if the isolation is extended to two days. In COVID-19 transmission, we estimate that implementing one day post-fever isolation would reduce the attack rate from 79% to 71%, and there is possible benefit from isolation for six days. In both influenza and COVID-19, the policies are predicted to reduce the peak number of infected but not shorten the outbreak duration.

Conclusions: Symptom-based isolation could be an important tool to control influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, and potentially other settings. We recommend that schools implement a post-fever isolation policy of two days for influenza and six days for COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Design Rapid systematic review and critical appraisal of prediction models for diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 infection.
Data sources PubMed, EMBASE via Ovid, Arxiv, medRxiv and bioRxiv until 24th March 2020.
Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable COVID-19 related prediction model. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full text. 
Data extraction Data from included studies were extracted independently by at least two authors based on the CHARMS checklist, and risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST. Data were extracted on various domains including the participants, predictors, outcomes, data analysis, and prediction model performance.
Results 2696 titles were screened. Of these, 27 studies describing 31 prediction models were included for data extraction and critical appraisal. We identified three models to predict hospital admission from pneumonia and other events (as a proxy for covid-19 pneumonia) in the general population; 18 diagnostic models to detect COVID-19 infection in symptomatic individuals (13 of which were machine learning utilising computed tomography (CT) results); and ten prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to a severe state, or length of hospital stay. Only one of these studies used data on COVID-19 cases outside of China. Most reported predictors of presence of COVID-19 in suspected patients included age, body temperature, and signs and symptoms. Most reported predictors of severe prognosis in infected patients included age, sex, features derived from CT, C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase, and lymphocyte count. 
Estimated C-index estimates for the prediction models ranged from 0.73 to 0.81 in those for the general population (reported for all 3 general population models), from 0.81 to &gt; 0.99 in those for diagnosis (reported for 13 of the 18 diagnostic models), and from 0.85 to 0.98 in those for prognosis (reported for 6 of the 10 prognostic models). All studies were rated at high risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, and poor statistical analysis, including high risk of model overfitting. Reporting quality varied substantially between studies. A description of the study population and intended use of the models was absent in almost all reports, and calibration of predictions was rarely assessed. 
Conclusion COVID-19 related prediction models are quickly entering the academic literature, to support medical decision making at a time where this is urgently needed. Our review indicates proposed models are poorly reported and at high risk of bias. Thus, their reported performance is likely optimistic and using them to support medical decision making is not advised. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed prediction models and validating (evaluating) existing models. The aforementioned predictors identified in multiple included studies could be considered as candidate predictors for new models. We also stress the need to follow methodological guidance when developing and validating prediction models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions. Finally, studies should adhere to the TRIPOD statement to facilitate validating, appraising, advocating and clinically using the reported models.

COVID−19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID−19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID−19 severity.

<jats:bold>Method</jats:bold>
This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID−19 infection or ICU admission.

<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>
Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID−19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 − 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 − 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 − 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 − 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 − 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 − 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity.

<jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>
Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID−19.</jats:p>"

But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 to summarize the characteristics of the COVID-19 registered clinical trials. Methods: This study is based on the recommendations of the PRISMA in the Cochrane handbook. The databases from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two researchers independently selected the literature based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. Results: A total of 75 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) of COVID-19 were obtained. A majority of clinical trials were sponsored by Chinese hospitals. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and none of the registered clinical trials had been completed; 34 trials were early clinical exploratory trials or in a pre-experiment stage, 15 trials belonged to phrase Ⅲ and 4 trials were phrase Ⅳ. The methods of intervention included traditional Chinese medicine involving 26 trials, Western medicine involving 30 trials, and integrated traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine involving 19 trials. The subjects were mainly non-critical adult patients (≥ 18 years old). The median sample size of the trials was 100 (IQR: 60 - 200), and the median execute time of the trials was 179 d (IQR: 94 - 366 d). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examinations. Overall, both the methodology quality of interventional trials and observational studies were low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will being carried out in China. However, based on the low methodology quality and small sample size and long studies execute time, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment in the near future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China.</jats:p>"

Going beyond a linear model, a  peak at about (9.5±2.6)°C seems to be present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown policies.

There is no evidence supporting that temperature changes COVID-19 transmission.

Methods
We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships.


Results
There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72℃ and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70℃ and 12.42℃ respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1℃ increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1℃ increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. 

Conclusion 
The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.</jats:p>"

Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020. 

Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. 

Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P&lt;0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed &lt;1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. 

Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.</jats:p>"

However, it is urgent to need the rapid and accurate detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis. We aimed to evaluate the antibodies-based and nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
Method: We retrospectively and observationally studied 133 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China, from Feb 17 to Mar 1, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes were collected. Data were compared between IgM-IgG antibody test and real-time RT-PCR detection for COVID-19 patients.
Results: Of 133 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were 44 moderate cases, 52 severe cases, and 37 critical cases with no significant difference of gender and age among three subgroups. Overall, the positive ratio in IgM antibody test was higher than in RT-PCR detection. In RT-PCR detection, the positive ratio was 65.91%, 71.15%, and 67.57% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Whereas, the positive ratio of IgM/IgG antibody detection in patients was 79.55%/93.18%, 82.69%/100%, and 72.97%/97.30% in moderate, severe, and critical cases, respectively. Moreover, the concentrations of antibodies were also measured in three subgroups.

Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. 

 

Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

The outbreak has quickly spread to more than 100 countries reporting over 100,000 confirmed cases. Australia reported its first case of COVID-19 on 25th January 2020 and has since implemented travel restrictions to stop further introduction of the virus. 

Methods: We analysed daily global COVID-19 data published by the World Health Organisation to investigate the spread of the virus thus far. To assess the current risk of COVID-19 importation and local spread in Australia we predict international passenger flows into Australia during 2020.

Findings: Our analysis of global data shows that Australia can expect a similar growth rate of reported cases as observed in France and the United States. We identify travel patterns of Australian citizens/residents and foreign travellers that can inform the implementation of new and the alteration of existing travel restrictions related to COVID-19.

Interpretation: Our findings identify the risk reduction potential of current travel bans, based on the proportion of returning travellers to Australia that are residents or visitors. The similarity of the exponential growth in the epidemic curve in Australia to other countries guides forecasts of COVID-19 growth in Australia, and opportunities for drawing lessons from other countries with more advanced outbreaks.</jats:p>"

Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. 

Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. 

Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. 

Conclusion: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities.</jats:p>"

Introduction : The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs where it may cause pneumonia
in severely ill patients. Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung
for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause
damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can
favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases
of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the
health professionals in the prevailing scenario.
Materials &amp; Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest
X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures
in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided
by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest
X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The
third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19
infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other
pathogens.
Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with
COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images
of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images
were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set)
ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray
images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved
diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19.
Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation
of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital
images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for
the health professionals.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. 

METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak.

FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic.

INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.</jats:p>"

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations.  Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 45% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had significant effects slowing this growth, although policy actions in the US appear to be too recent to have a substantial impact since the magnitude of these effects grows over time. Our results suggest that similar policies may have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large and beneficial health outcomes. We estimate that, to date, current policies have already prevented or delayed on the order of eighty-million infections. These findings may help inform whether or when ongoing policies should be lifted or intensified, and they can support decision-making in the over 150 countries where COVID-19 has been detected but not yet achieved high infection rates.</jats:p>"

The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China.  The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community.</jats:p>"

Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards.  We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases.  We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date.  The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths.   The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider.  Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic. The epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.</jats:p>"

The ability of countries to contain and control transmission is critical in the absence of a vaccine. We evaluated a range of social distancing measures to determine which strategies are most effective in reducing the peak daily infection rate, and consequential pressure on the health care system.
Methods Using COVID19 transmission data from the outbreak source in Hubei Province, China, collected prior to activation of containment measures, we adapted an established individual based simulation model of the city of Newcastle, Australia, population 272,409. Simulation of virus transmission in this community model without interventions provided a baseline from which to compare alternative social distancing strategies. The infection history of each individual was determined, as was the time infected. From this model generated data, the rate of growth in cases, the magnitude of the epidemic peak, and the outbreak duration were obtained.
Findings The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non-attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration. These were also found to be effective even after 10 weeks delay from index case arrivals. The most effective single intervention was found to be increasing case isolation, to 100 percent of children and 90 percent of adults.
Interpretation As strong social distancing intervention strategies had the most effect in reducing the epidemic peak, this strategy may be considered when weaker strategies are first tried and found to be less effective. Questions arise as to the duration of strong social distancing measures, given they are highly disruptive to society. Tradeoffs may need to be made between the effectiveness of social distancing strategies and population willingness to adhere to them.</jats:p>"

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, however, the factors affecting the mortality remain unclear.
Methods 
Thirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearman analysis.
Results
The mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P &lt; 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P &lt; 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012).
Conclusions
Our findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 cases.</jats:p>"

Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread.

We have developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread.

Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> = 2.92 and latent period τ = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> (1.4), if the R<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.</jats:p>"

Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.</jats:p>"

Patient(s): Fertility patients seen within the last year
Intervention(s): None
Main Outcome Measure(s): Patient agreement with the ASRM recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the emotional impact rated on a Likert scale
Result(s): A total of 518 patients completed the survey for a response rate of 17%. Fifty percent of respondents had a cycle canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those who had a cycle cancelled, 85% of respondents found it to be moderately to extremely upsetting with 22% rating it to be equivalent to the loss of a child. There was no difference on the emotional impact based on the type of cycle cancelled. Fifty-five percent of patients agreed that diagnostic procedures such as hysterosalpingograms should be cancelled while 36% of patients agreed all fertility cycles should be cancelled. Patients were slightly more likely to agree with the ASRM guidelines if they have an upcoming cycle cancelled (p = 0.041).

They are under high risk of being infected and high mental stress, which may lead to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression.
Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate sleep disturbances of fMW and made a comparison with non-fMW. The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI&gt;7 points or/and AIS&gt;6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted.
Findings A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (p＜0.0001), AIS (p＜0.0001), anxiety (p＜0.0001) and depression (p=0.0010), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI &gt; 7 points (p＜0.0001) and AIS &gt; 6 points (p＜0.0001).

The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including increased lymphocyte counts (0.65*109/L vs. 0.76*109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L).

In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history,  symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 .
Findings 
Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact.  12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.
 Interpretation
While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.

Like other respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus remains only about two months in any given population, yet the peak incidence and the lethality can vary. The data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, and Italy were hit by the more dangerous ""SKII""  variant. While the epidemic in China is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the course of the epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing and the peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the US first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. While containment merely prolongs the time the disease circulates until the proportion of immune people is high enough for ""herd immunity"", reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease.</jats:p>"
medRxiv,10.1101/2020.03.09.20033415,NA,2020-03-13,The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects,"<jats:p>Background
COVID-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the United States, including school closures. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. 

Methods
We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality.

Findings  
The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%.   
    
Conclusion 
School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality.</jats:p>"

We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.</jats:p>"

To investigate the impact of temperature and absolute humidity on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. 
DESIGN
Ecological study. 
SETTING
31 provincial-level regions in mainland China. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Data on COVID-19 incidence and climate between Jan 20 and Feb 29, 2020.
RESULTS
The number of new confirm COVID-19 cases in mainland China peaked on Feb 1, 2020. COVID-19 daily incidence were lowest at -10 ℃ and highest at 10 ℃,while the maximum incidence was observed at the absolute humidity of approximately 7 g/m3. COVID-19 incidence changed with temperature as daily incidence decreased when the temperature rose. No significant association between COVID-19 incidence and absolute humidity was observed in distributed lag nonlinear models. Additionally, A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale.
CONCLUSION
Temperature is an environmental driver of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Lower and higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. M-SEIR models help to better evaluate environmental and social impacts on COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study.
Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists.
Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic.</jats:p>"

The Wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by an estimated 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29), delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in China. Other cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively reported 33.3% (11.1-44.4%) fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks (13.0; 7.1-18.8) compared with cities that started control later (20.6; 14.5-26.8). Among interventions investigated here, the most effective were suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings. The national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic and, by 19 February (day 50), had averted hundreds of thousands of cases across China.</jats:p>"

Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. 
Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis.
Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.</jats:p>"

Objectives.  To understand whether the institutional and cultural context influences the COVID-19 outbreak.
Methods.  At the ecological level, regression coefficients are examined to figure out contextual variables influencing the pandemic's exponential growth rate across 96 countries. 
Results.  While a strong institutional context is negatively associated with the outbreak (B = -0.55 ... -0.64, p &lt; 0.001), the pandemic's growth rate is steeper in countries with a quality education system (B = 0.33, p &lt; 0.001). Countries with an older population are more affected (B = 0.46, p &lt; 0.001). Societies with individualistic (rather than collectivistic) values experience a flatter rate of pathogen proliferation (B = -0.31, p &lt; 0.001), similarly for higher levels of power distance (B = -0.32, p &lt; 0.001). Hedonistic values, that is seeking indulgence and not enduring restraints, are positively related to the outbreak (B = 0.23, p = 0.001).
Conclusions.  The results emphasize the need for public policy makers to pay close attention to the institutional and cultural context in their respective countries when instigating measures aimed at constricting the pandemic's growth.</jats:p>"

The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.</jats:p>"

After the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) starting in late 2019, a number of researchers have reported the predicted the virus transmission dynamics. However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. 
Methods and findings:
We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6±10 in Wuhan and March 20±16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly.
Conclusions:
The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV.</jats:p>"

Through careful inspection of the spleens and lymph nodes (LNs) from six cases with postmortem examinations, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect secondary lymphoid organs to induce cell death. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2, expresses on tissue-resident CD169+ macrophages in spleens and LNs. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) can be found in ACE2+ cells, CD169+ macrophages, but not in CD3+ T cells or B220+ B cells in spleens and LNs. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe tissue damage including lymph follicle depletion, splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. Moreover, in situ TUNEL staining illustrated that viral infection leads to severe lymphocyte apoptosis, which might be mediated by viral antigens inducing Fas upregulation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 also triggers macrophages to produce IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that directly promotes lymphocyte necrosis.

Many countries have banned groups and gatherings as part of their response to the pandemic caused by the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Although there are outbreak reports involving mass gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown.  
Methods
We used data from a survey of social contact behaviour that specifically asked about contact with groups to estimate the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) due to groups as the relative change in the Basic Reproduction Number when groups are prevented. 
Findings
We estimate that PAF due to groups of 50+ people is 2.2% (95%CI 1.1%, 3.6%); the PAF due to groups of 20+ people is 6.4% (5.0%, 8.0%); the PAF due to groups of 10+ is 11.3% (9.9%, 13.0%)

Background: 
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring.
Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed.
Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.</jats:p>"

We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. 
Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran. Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. 
Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above. 
Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Background: The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus has been sustained in China since December 2019, and could become a pandemic if we do not contain it. The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal (≤49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (≥70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status.

Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (βvalue=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). Similar things were observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (βvalue=3.67, CI: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (βvalue=4.44, CI: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028).
Conclusion: Our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the COVID-19 epidemic.</jats:p>"

Despite the sharp rise in the incidence of COVID-19, authoritative recommendations to limit the spread of SARS-CoV2 within gastrointestinal endoscopy units are lacking. Therefore, with the primary aim of identifying best practice and scrutinizing its supporting evidence, we conducted a systematic review of literature for articles published between 1 January 2002 and 15 March 2020 in five databases relating to both the current SARS-CoV2 and the previous SARS-CoV outbreaks. Official websites for gastroenterology and endoscopy societies in the 15 most affected countries were also searched. Unfortunately, a paucity of high quality data and heterogeneity of recommendations between countries was observed. Interestingly, not all countries advocated the postponement of non-urgent or elective procedures. Recommendations for patient screening and personal protective equipment were commonly featured in all recommendations but specifics varied. Only 32% (9/28) of all gastroenterology and endoscopy societies issued guidance on endoscopy in the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, stronger evidence to inform current practice and robust guidelines are urgently needed to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in gastrointestinal endoscopy departments worldwide.</jats:p>"

As the epidemic outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), general population may experience psychological distress. Evidence has suggested that negative coping styles may be related to subsequent mental illness. Therefore, we investigate the general population's psychological distress and coping styles in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Methods
A cross-sectional battery of surveys was conducted from February 1-4, 2020. The Kessler 6 psychological distress scale, the simplified coping style questionnaire and a general information questionnaire were administered on-line to a convenience sample of 1599 in China. Spearman's correlation was used to measure the correlations among category variables.

Results
General population's psychological distress were significant differences based on age, marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, concern with media reports, and perceived impacts of the epidemic outbreak (all p &lt;0.001) except gender (p=0.316). Those with a history of visiting Wuhan and a history of epidemics occurring in the community, more concern with media reports, perceived more severe impacts and negative coping style had a higher level of psychological distress, which was significantly positively correlated with a history of visiting Wuhan (r=0.548, p&lt;0.001), a history of epidemics occurring in the community (r=0.219, p&lt;0.001), and concern with media reports (r=0.192, p&lt;0.001). Coping styles were significantly different across all category variables (all p &lt;0.001), and negatively correlated with other category variables (all p&lt;0.01) except age and marriage. Psychological distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style (r=-0.573, p&lt;0.01).

Conclusions
In the early stages of COVID-19, general population with epidemic contact characteristics, excessive concern with media reports, and perceived more severe impacts have higher levels of psychological distress. Psychological distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style. Interventions should be implemented early, especially for those population with a high level of psychological distress and/or with a negative coping style.</jats:p>"

Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.</jats:p>"

The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on  January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried.
Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. 
Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

They are presented as a tool that can serve to explore plausible scenarios of spread and impact, effectiveness and consequences of contention and mitigation policies.

It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective.
We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19.
Countries' vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries' management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.</jats:p>"

We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R_0 will be under-estimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease.

In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic.  We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present.  For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak.  In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately.
    
We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not.  We believe that is a policy question.  If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place.  Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.</jats:p>"

It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.</jats:p>"

The disease is sweeping through Lombardy, which remains in lockdown since the 8th of March. As of the same day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy have been extended to the entire country. On March 11, the WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of exposed/infected cases in the total population; (c) the basic reproduction number (R0); (d) the ""effective"" per-day disease transmission and mortality rates; and, importantly, (e) a forecast for the fade out of the outbreak on the basis of the released data of confirmed cases for Lombardy from February 21 to March 8, the day of lockdown.\par 
Methods.
To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a new compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the ``effective"" per-day transmission and mortality rates for which no clinical data are available, we have used the SEIRD simulator to fit the data from February 21 to the 8th of March, the lockdown day of Lombardy and of all Italy. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. Based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. Furthermore, based on an estimation for the reduction in the ""effective"" transmission rate of the disease as of March 8 that reflects the suspension of almost all activities in Italy, we ran the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy from mobile phone data released on March 17, the effect of social distancing, and the draconian measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020.
Findings.
Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the actual cumulative number of exposed cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases. According to this scenario, the DAY-ZERO for the outbreak in Lombardy was the 21st of January 2020. The ""effective"" per-day disease transmission rate for the period until March 8 was found to be 0.779 (90% CI: 0.777-0.781), while the ""effective"" per-day mortality rate was found to be 0.0174 (90% CI: 0.0154-0.0192). Based on these values, the basic reproduction rate R0 was found to be 4.04 (90% CI: 4.03-4.05). Importantly, simulations show that the fade out of the COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy is expected to occur by the end of May - early June, 2020, if the draconian, as of March 20 and March 21, measures are maintained.</jats:p>"

The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. Intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two ``zero"" points, respectively. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak.

Method. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two ``zero"" points. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

Results. Results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. The first prediction results on Jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland China beyond Hubei Province would appear on Jan 31st and Feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.</jats:p>"

This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.</jats:p>"

We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities.</jats:p>"

While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated.
Methods: Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidenceincluding contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission together with the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions.
Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) for human-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reporting rate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinical patients constitute a substantial component of the epidemic's magnitude. Findings suggest that the development of rapid diagnostic tests could help bring the epidemic more rapidly under control.</jats:p>"

In this study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen.
Methods: Daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases. 
Results: Although Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February.
Conclusion: The lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, cities with similar epidemic trend could have different transmission dynamics given the variation in imported cases.</jats:p>"

Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness.
Methods:
Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test.
Results:
Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 &amp;ldquo:generations” was observed. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. Most patients had typical symptoms, 5 asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days. Just 9 of 16 severe patients required ICU care. Until Feb 12, 2020, 40 (38.46%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. For the antiviral treatment, 80 (76.92%) patients received traditional Chinese medicine therapy.
Conclusions:
Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers. Asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID-19. The incubation period of 8 patients exceeded 14 days.</jats:p>"

Methods: The information of COVID-19 and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 853 confirmed COVID-19 patients obtained from the website of health committees of 18 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed COVID-19 case data. Results: The growth rate of new cases and deaths of COVID-19 were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05 ± 17.22) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.12: 1. Conclusions: The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher.

Our model features delay terms to account for (a) the time lapse or latency period between contracting the disease and displaying symptoms, and (b) the time lag in testing patients for the virus due to the limited numbers of testing facilities currently available. We find that the delay introduces a significant disparity between the actual and reported time-trajectories of cases in a particular region. Specifically, the reported case histories lag the actual histories by a few days. Hence, to minimize the spread of the disease, lockdowns and similarly drastic social isolation measures need to be imposed some time before the reported figures are approaching their peak values. We then account for the social reality that lockdowns can only be of a limited duration in view of practical considerations. We find that the most effective interval for imposing such a limited-time lockdown is one where the midpoint of the lockdown period coincides with the actual peak of the spread of the disease in the absence of the lockdown. We further show that the true effectivity of imposing a lockdown may be misrepresented and grossly underestimated by the reported case trajectories in the days following the action.</jats:p>"

However, the impact of the public health interventions in China needs to be evaluated. We established a SEIRD model to simulate the transmission trend of China. In addition, the reduction of the reproductive number was estimated under the current forty public health interventions policies. Furthermore, the infection curve, daily transmission replication curve, and the trend of cumulative confirmed cases were used to evaluate the effects of the public health interventions. Our results showed that the SEIRD curve model we established had a good fit and the basic reproductive number is 3.38 (95% CI, 3.25-3.48). The SEIRD curve show a small difference between the simulated number of cases and the actual number; the correlation index (H2) is 0.934, and the reproductive number (R) has been reduced from 3.38 to 0.5 under the current forty public health interventions policies of China. The actual growth curve of new cases, the virus infection curve, and the daily transmission replication curve were significantly going down under the current public health interventions.

We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission.
Methods:  We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin,  China,  reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations.
Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective.
Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring.  Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.</jats:p>"

Methods: We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. 
Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. 
Conclusions: The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.</jats:p>"

The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate for India stands around 1.9. Kerala and Maharashtra are the top two infected states in India with more than 100 infected cases reported in each state, respectively. A total of 25 states have reported at least one infected case, however only 8 of them have reported deaths due to COVID-19.

Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. 
Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. 
Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes.

The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling.
Method: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty.
Findings: We estimated that R_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.
Interpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.

In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels.  Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. 
METHODS:  CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise.  Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and patient-specific variables.
RESULTS:  In the 26 patients (aged 21-77, median 57 years), anaerobic threshold ranged from 7.6-24.5 (median 12.35) ml.min-1kg-1 and placed more than half of the patients (15, 57.7%) in the &gt;11 ml.min-1kg-1 category suggested as lower-risk for intra-abdominal surgeries.  Neither age nor baseline SpO2 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 to 183 (median 156)g.L-1.   However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and oxygen pulse were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase of 25g.L-1 placed a further 7/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category.  For patients completing the VSAQ, derived metabolic equivalents were strongly associated with anaerobic threshold enabling risk evaluations through a simple questionnaire.
CONCLUSIONS:  Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings. These data support approaches to risk reduction by aerobic conditioning and attention to anaemia.  The VSAQ is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment to implement during triage/screening.</jats:p>"

Changsha, a city located south to the epicenter, was soon impacted. To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID-19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the diagnosis in practice. While SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is being alerted in many countries, our report will be helpful to other colleagues in rapid identification of COVID-19 cases and controlling the transmission of the disease.</jats:p>"

However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.</jats:p>"

The research community is interested to know what are the hotspots in coronavirus (CoV) research and how much is known about COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving coronaviruses as well as COVID-19 by using a topic modeling analysis.
Methods: We extracted all abstracts and retained the most informative words from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, which contains all the 35,092 pieces of coronavirus related literature published up to March 20, 2020. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation modeling, we trained an eight-topic model from the corpus. We then analyzed the semantic relationships between topics and compared the topic distribution between COVID-19 and other CoV infections.
Results: Eight topics emerged overall: clinical characterization, pathogenesis research, therapeutics research, epidemiological study, virus transmission, vaccines research, virus diagnostics, and viral genomics. It was observed that COVID-19 research puts more emphasis on clinical characterization, epidemiological study, and virus transmission at present. In contrast, topics about diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, genomics and pathogenesis only accounted for less than 10% or even 4% of all the COVID-19 publications, much lower than those of other CoV infections.
Conclusions: These results identified knowledge gaps in the area of COVID-19 and offered directions for future research.

As of 27 March 2020, there were more than 500,000 confirmed cases and 23,335 deaths worldwide. In those places with a rapid growth in numbers of sick people in need of hospitalization and intensive care, this demand has over-saturate the medical facilities and, in turn, rise the mortality rate.
In the absence of a vaccine, classical epidemiological measures such as testing, quarantine and physical distancing are ways to reduce the growing speed of new infections. Thus, these measures should be a priority for all governments in order to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated to this disease. 
System dynamics is widely used in many fields of the biological sciences to study and explain changing systems. The system dynamics approach can help us understand the rapid spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 and also generate scenarios to test the effect of different control measures. 
The aim of this study is to provide an open model (using STELLA® from Iseesystems) that can be customized to any area/region and by any user, allowing them to evaluate the different behavior of the COVID-19 dynamics under different scenarios. Thus, our intention is not to generate a model to accurately predict the evolution of the disease nor to supplant others more robust -official and non-official- from governments and renowned institutions. We believe that scenarios comparison can be an effective tool to convince the society of the need of a colossal and unprecedented effort to reduce new infections and ultimately, fatalities.</jats:p>"

Those who stopped working reported worse mental and physical health conditions as well as distress. The severity of COVID-19 in a location predicts life satisfaction, and this relationship is contingent upon the existing chronic health issues and hours of exercise of the individuals. Our evidence supports the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epidemiologically, especially for people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results highlight that physically active people might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues during the lockdown.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has also been suggested to initiate a cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19 evidenced by elevated cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP).

We report preliminary data from 21 patients with COVID-19 who developed pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and participated in a compassionate-use program at Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, Italy.

All 21 patients received intravenous siltuximab, a chimeric mAb that binds to and blocks the effect of IL-6, at a dose ranging between 700 to 1,200 mg (median 900 mg). The median age of patients treated was 64 years, and all patients were followed for a median of eight days. Serum CRP levels reduced in all 16 patients with available data following treatment. An improvement in the clinical condition was observed in 33% (7/21) of patients, 43% (9/21) of patients stabilized as evidenced by no clinically relevant change in their condition, and 24% (5/21) experienced a worsening in their condition. Of those patients who experienced a worsening in their condition, one patient died, and one patient experienced a cerebrovascular event.

However, a failure to identify early cases imported to a country, bottlenecks in RT-PCR testing, and the existence of infections which are asymptomatic, sub-clinical, or with an alternative presentation than the standard cough and fever have resulted in an under-counting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how publicly available CDC influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be repurposed to estimate the detection rate of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average and show that this surge is correlated with COVID case counts across states. By quantifying the number of excess ILI patients in March relative to previous years and comparing excess ILI to confirmed COVID case counts, we estimate the symptomatic case detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the US to be 1/100 to 1/1000. This corresponds to approximately 10 million presumed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients across the US during the week starting on March 15, 2020. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the US, we also show that the early epidemic in the US was unlikely to be doubling slower than every three days. Together these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID epidemic in the US in which rapid spread across the US are combined with a large population of infected patients with presumably mild-to-moderate clinical symptoms. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data, and discuss the broader potential to repurpose outpatient time series for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.</jats:p>"

Objective: To apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among the general public in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK).
Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 3,000 adults residing in the US and 3,000 adults residing in the UK who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Strata by age (18 - 27, 28 - 37, 38 - 47, 48 - 57, or &gt;=58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (White, Black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, Mixed, or ""Other""), and all permutations of these strata, were established. The number of participants who could enrol in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrolment into the survey within the strata was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2 2020. 
Results: 2,986 and 2,988 adults residing in the US and the UK, respectively, completed the questionnaire. 64.4% (1,924/2,986) of US and 51.5% (1,540/2,988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree. 67.5% (2,015/2,986) of US participants had a total household income between $20,000 and $99,999, and 74.4% (2,223/2,988) of UK participants had a total household income between GBP15,000 and GBP74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 5.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR: 2.0% - 10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of Covid-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI: 36.1% - 39.6%) of US and 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% - 31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was 'highly effective' in protecting them from acquiring Covid-19. 25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% - 27.2%) of US and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.0% - 31.3%) of UK participants thought it prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8% [95% CI: 52.1% - 55.6%] of US and 39.1% [95% CI: 37.4% - 40.9%] of UK participants) thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.</jats:p>"

The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution.
Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. 
Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. 
Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.</jats:p>"

As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is increasing exponentially in the United States and worldwide, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. As such, strategies to safely expand the lifespan of the supply of medical equipment are critically important. In the recent days, weeks, and months, in
the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve Personal Protective Equipment, including sterilization after use. Some hospitals have already begun using UV-C light to sterilize N95 respirators, but many lack the space or equipment to implement existing protocols. In this study, we outline a procedure by which N95 respirators may be sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories. The primary obstacle to this approach is the possibility the UV radiation levels vary within BSCs. To account for this potential
variation in dosing across the base of the BSC, we tested the UV-C radiation in two randomly chosen idle BSCs in our research institute and observed a maximum ratio between the minimum and maximum recorded intensities within a given BSC to be 1.98. Based on these values, we calculated that an N95 mask placed within a BSC with a manufacturer reported fluence of 100 μW/cm^2 should be effectively sanitized for reuse after approximately
15-20 minutes per side. Our results provide support to healthcare organizations looking for alternative methods to extend their reserves of PPE. It is our hope that with an easily implemented strategy, as we have presented here, idle BSCs can be utilized to alleviate the PPE shortage by providing a way to sterilize PPE to allow safe daily re-use. This should be tested on a larger scale, and confirmed in a virology laboratory before adoption, though we
contend that in extremis, this method would be preferred compared to re-use without sterilization.</jats:p>"

We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature ≥37.3C.
Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P &lt;0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P &lt;0.001).

Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P &lt; 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P &gt; 0.05).

A pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading over the world. However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort.

<jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>
We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 

<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>
The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and stools, respectively. Only 13 urines (5.6%) and 12 plasmas (5.7%) were viral positive. Prolonged viral shedding was observed in severe patients than that of non-severe patients. Cough but not fever, aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory specimens, meanwhile the positive stool-RNA appeared to align with the proportion who concurrently had cough and sputum production, but not diarrhea. Typical coronaviral particles could be found directly in sputum by TEM. The anti-nucleocapsid-protein IgM started on day 7 and positive rate peaked on day 28, while that of IgG was on day 10 and day 49 after illness onset. IgM and IgG appear earlier, and their titers are significantly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (p&lt;0.05). The weak responders for IgG had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders (p= 0.011). 

<jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold>
Nasopharyngeal, sputum and stools rather than blood and urine, were the major shedding routes for SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile sputum had a prolonged viral shedding. Symptom cough seems to be aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory and fecal specimens.

A total of 66 upper respiratory swabs, 51 feces, 56 urine and 56 plasma samples were sequentially collected from 23 patients in a designated hospital. The plasma and urine samples were all negative, except for urine samples from two severe cases at the latest available detection point. Conversely, virus was shed in respiratory swabs and feces samples during the diseased period. Ten of 12 (83.3%) cases were positive for feces samples, while 14 of 21 (66.7%) were positive for respiratory samples. In addition, the median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in the upper respiratory swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces. Notably, at 26 days after discharge, case 3 (a 45-year-old) was detected positive again in the feces samples, but appears to be healthy and negative for respiratory swabs. These results indicated that beside respiratory samples, intestinal samples (e.g. feces) should be recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19, especially before a patient discharge and for monitoring the relapse of discharged patients.</jats:p>"

To investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of SARS- CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.</jats:p>"

The Chinese government implemented a metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city on 23rd January
2020 to curb the epidemic of the coronavirus COVID-19. Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We
modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted.
Method:
We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at
different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and
facial mask usage on the epidemic.

Results:
We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.6%) would be infected through public contacts, 45,795 (32,390-66,395, 69.7%) through household contact, 3,633 (2,344-5,865, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 783 (553-1,134) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,850 (1,801-4,981) medical staff members). A total of 3,262 (1,592-6,470) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. For an early lifting date (21st March), facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate (≥85%) if public contacts were to recover to 100% of the pre-quarantine level. In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (&lt;50%) combined with an increased public contact (&gt;100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage. 

Conclusion:
The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but
requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.</jats:p>"

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)，TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.</jats:p>"

Empirical Research Based on Prevention and Control Cases in China,"<jats:p>Various epidemic prevention and control measures aimed at reducing person-to-person contact has paid a certain cost while controlling the epidemic. So accurate evaluation of these measures helps to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control while minimizing social costs. In this paper, we develop the model in Dirk Brockmann and Dirk Helbing (2013) to theoretically explain the impact mechanism of traffic control and social distancing measures on the spread of the epidemic, and empirically tests the effect of the two measures in China at the present stage using econometric approach. We found that both traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the development of the epidemic. Nationally, social distancing measures are better than traffic control measures; the two measures are complementary and their combined action will play a better epidemic prevention effect; Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only works in cities with higher GDP per capita and population size, while fails in cities with lower GDP per capita and population size. In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative; the rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The findings above verify the effectiveness and correctness of the measures implemented in China at present, at the same time, we propose that it is necessary to fully consider the respective characteristics of the two measures, cooperating and complementing each other; what's more, measures should be formulated according to the city's own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention; Finally, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide emotions of the public in a proper way, enhancing public confidence.</jats:p>"

We formulate both a survival probability model and an associated infection duration-dependent SIR model to define individual- and population-based estimates of dynamic mortality ratios. The key parameters that affect the dynamics of the different mortality estimates are the incubation period and the length of time individuals were infected before confirmation of infection. We stress that none of these ratios are accurately represented by the often misinterpreted case fatality ratio (CFR), the number of deaths to date divided by the total number of infected cases to date. Using available data on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and simple assumptions, we estimate and compare the different dynamic mortality ratios and highlight their differences. Informed by our modeling, we propose a more systematic method to determine mortality ratios during epidemic outbreaks and discuss sensitivity to confounding effects and errors in the data.</jats:p>"

Prevalence matters,"<jats:p>SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is a global pandemic disease (COVID-19). Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (&gt; 90%) and positive predictive value (69 - 84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.</jats:p>"

The questions we address are these: 

(1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much?

(2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity?

(3) When should such strategies be implemented?

Our answers are as follows:

(1)  The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten.  

(2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late.

(3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate.  The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful.  After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation.  In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation.  But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed.

Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest.  If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and then strong mitigation/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too late.</jats:p>"

SI Tables in the paper submitted data shows the abundance of the bacteria, but there is no mention of this in the paper [4]. Similarly, another paper from China does not report Prevotella among the metagenomic bacteria, but it is clearly present [5].Sequencing data (N=3) shows Wuhan coronavirus integration in bacteria (Prevotella mostly) [7]. Is this sequencing artifact - or is the virus infecting both bacterial and human cells (which would be a first) [8]?If true, this explains the very high false negatives. We are looking for RNA (see the CDC test details given below) - which wont be detected when the virus is in the lysogenic state [9]. Only with higher bacterial concentration, and when the virus goes in the lytic state, will the RT-PCR test give a positive.Note, the very low nCov reads in 5 patients from China (Table 1).Whistle blower Dr Li Wenliang, who tragically passed away, took 20 days for a +ve nCoV test [10].</p>"

Previous studies showed that some virus could affect the reproductive system and cause long-term complications. Recent studies exploring the source of 2019-nCoV using genomic sequencing have revealed that 2019-nCoV enters the host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), the receptor that recognizes 2019-nCoV. To investigate the expression of ACE2 and to explore the potential risk of infection in the reproductive system, we performed a thorough bioinformatic analysis on data from public databases involving RNA expression, protein expression, and single-cell RNA expression studies. The analyzed data showed high levels of ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in the testis and spermatids and equal levels of ACE2 expression in the uterus and lung. Comprehensive single-cell analysis identified ACE2 expression in the lung, testis, spermatids, and uterus. In conclusion, this study revealed the potential risk associated with the 2019-nCoV infection in the reproductive system and predicted that long-term complications might have a significant impact on the prevention and management of COVID-19, the disease caused upon infection with 2019-nCoV.</p>"

Identifying the best method to collect samples is critical to avoid false negatives, as often there is not enough viral load to constitute on full genome [4,5]. Here, I analyze the viral (and bacterial) load from RNA-seq data submitted for 10 patients from China (Wuhan, Tiananmen and Jingzhou) - covering bronchoalveolar lavage, throat swab, feces and sputum (Accid:PRJNA616446).Bronchoalveolar lavage is the best method to obtain SAR-Cov2 samplesBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is clearly the best region to obtain SAR-Cov2 samples, while sputum is the worst (Table 1). That BAL is good has been reported earlier - ‘bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens showed the highest positive rates (14 of 15; 93%)’ [6]. This is contrary to previous reports, which stated that sputum was better than throat swabs (BAL was not done) [7,8]. Note, there is only one sputum sample, so the sample size may be a confounding factor. Another paper has compared BAL to peripheral blood mononuclear cells [9]. These are reads per million.

The application of other viruses to compete with the novel coronavirus was proposed in this paper. On the viewpoint of receptor competition, resource competition, and cross immunity, an attempt should be made to select a natural virus, such as the common coronavirus causing the common cold in human, or transform a virus with biotechnology in order to resist the novel coronavirus. Similar scenarios were suggested to be used to deal with other viruses like human immunodeficiency virus. Microecological communities of viruses could form an independent research area to dig the deeper biological and medical significance.

The present study proposed that the infectiousness of RNAs was one of the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Possible explanations included RNAs controlling replication and metabolic processes of SARS-CoV-2, the estimated stabilization time of RNAs in the air being enough for them to transmit from person to person, the infectious disease transmitted by free RNAs having been reported, etc. The comparison between SARS-CoV-2 RNAs to proteins ratio in the environment and that ratio in the virus particles could be conducted to prove the presence of free RNA genomes of the virus in the environment. Spatial array methods to detect the spatial distribution of RNAs should be applicated to assess the risk of viral infection in public places, rooms, refrigerators, etc. The different amounts of viral RNA strands and proteins was one of the candidate reasons to explain the phenomenon of asymptomatic infection. More stringent protective measures based on the infectiousness of RNAs were provided. Although this viewpoint needs to be proved, some mentioned proposals and protective measures are useful to control the spread of viral diseases.</p>"

While TAP1 functions to enhance presentation of class I-associated peptides to CD8 cytotoxic T-cells, TAP1 also enhances presentation of major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) receptors (4).  One criteria natural killer cells use to lyse cells is the absence of surface MHC-I (5), and hepatitis C virus up-regulates TAP1 to increase surface expression of MHC-I and inhibit NK-cell cytotoxicity and promote infection (6).

Multiple-dose  BCG  vaccine  repurposing  for  COVID-19  will  be  an  uprising breakthrough  of  vaccine  discovery  with  safer  outcomes.  BCG  induces  cross-protection  that might  not  be  related  to  the  target  disease  as  innate  immune  cells,  including  monocytes  and natural  killer  cells,  contribute  to  this  immune  protection  as  known  as  “trained  immunity”  [1]. BCG  had  multifaceted  protection  against  TB,  Leprosy  &amp;amp;  heterogeneous  pathogens  [2]. Moreover,  it  was  repositioned  as  a  treatment  for  type-1  diabetes,  many  types  of  cancer  &amp;amp; multiple  sclerosis  [2].  BCG  vaccine  accelerates  the  “resetting”  of  the  immune  system  [3]  or  “turn on”  immunity  mechanism  that  agrees  with  its  pleiotropic  repurposing  for  many  diseases. Multiple-dose  BCG  vaccine  was  used  for  reversing  type-1  diabetes  &amp;amp;  for  treating  bladder  cancer [4-5].  While  intravesical  multiple  doses  of  BCG  for  bladder  cancer  showed  many  complications [6-7],  intradermal  multiple  doses  of  BCG  for  diabetes  showed  high  safety  profile  [4].   As  recent  studies  have  shown  that  upon  certain  vaccinations,  human  innate  immune  cells can  undergo  extensive  metabolic  and  epigenetic  reprogramming,  which  results  in  enhanced immune  responses  upon  heterologous  re-infection,  a  process  termed  trained  immunity  [8];  The author  recommends  that  COVID-19  vaccination  clinical  trials  should  consider  multiple  doses  of BCG.  After  reviewing  the  recent  COVID-19  literature,  although  some  preliminary  studies suggested  BCG  to  fight  COVID-19  [9-12],  they  did  not  consider  the  use  of  multiple  intradermal BCG  vaccination  (at  least  2  doses,  4  weeks  apart  [4])  for  the  prophylaxis  of  COVID-19  outbreak. I  do  recommend  that  diabetic  patients  should  participate  in  clinical  trials  to  benefit  from  the reported  BCG  anti-hyperglycemic  effect  [4].  What  if  safe  multiple  doses  of  BCG  turned  on  the immunity  and  protected  people  from  COVID-19  more  efficiently  than  a  single  dose?</p>"

Such an estimate for the total European population is 2.1%. Please note, this estimate is very rough and unlikely to hold true due to multiple biases of the data for the unfolding pandemic; in contrast, the population age structures data are of good quality. Thus, whatever the total infected population is and the absolute values of age-specific case-fatality ratios, the relative differences between regions would hold as long as the age-specific profile of case-fatality ratios stays proportional. This map reflects the unequal population age structures rather than the precise figures on COVID-19 fatality. It's a demographic perspective.</p>"

OSF Preprints,10.31219/osf.io/upj9w,NA,2020-03-25,"Covid-19, climate change and breakdown of the global Markov blanket","<p>It may be no coincidence that with the Covid-19 pandemic we are witnessing human suffering on a global scale, at the same time that we face catastrophic effects of climate change caused by our negligence as human beings towards our environment and planet. We live in interdependence with our environment at a hierarchy of scales; from the fertilised egg in the womb, the newborn with mother, children with parents and family, adults in societies, and finally societies in interdependence with our planet. This paper reviews the processes of interaction at hierarchical levels as forms of “communication”, often deeply unconscious and non-verbal, to better understand what we might be dealing with during this present crisis, and how to respond in addition to the obvious medical and epidemiological considerations.Recent developments in theoretical neuroscience highlight the interactive nature by which biological entities, in particular human beings, are influenced by their environment and in turn through their actions influence and potentially change that same environment in a normally never-ending dance. At the level of individuals in society, the arena for this dance is the outer sensory world from which we receive input via our senses, as well as from our body, all processed in relation to memory via incredibly fast unconscious loops, leading to actions and behaviour; supporting and largely creating our sense of “I”. A quite different research project examining changes in brain activity during Buddhist jhāna meditation has shown that if a meditator disengages his/her personal “I” from their default sensory consciousness, then a different pattern of brain activity along a vertical brain–body axis develops, with “jhāna consciousness” experienced subjectively as a more timeless embodied “presence”. Taken together, these results accord with theoretical predictions that life as a whole is supported by nested hierarchical systems, each delineated by a “Markov blanket”. The most primary system for our everyday experience of “I am”, and “I do”, is our relation to the external sensory world, which we term the human default (sensory) consciousness. Inner to this is then the brain–body system revealed in the special case of jhāna meditation, with an accompanying consciousness experienced as presence rather that the default sensory consciousness of “this” or “that”. Which then leads us to consider the outer encompassing level of planet Earth–societies, and whether at this global scale we are witnessing breakdown of the outermost Markov blanket evidenced by parallel chaotic and destructive climate change at the outer level, and the recent destructive Covid-19 pandemic affecting the inner societal level.</p>"

Aim: The objective of this review was to synthesize existing data on the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) on N95 FFR decontamination. Methods: We conducted a systematic review on UVGI in N95 FFRs by using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility and extracted and verified predefined data fields. Original research reporting on N95 FFR function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included. Findings and Conclusions: Twelve studies were identified, comprising of 53 different UVGI intervention arms and 43 N95 FFR models. In all cases, FFRs maintained National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H2O (7.97-11.70 mm H2O) vs 9.85 mm H2O (8.33-11.44 mm H2O) for UVGI treatment arms. All UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose &amp;gt;20,000 J/m2 resulted in a 2 log reduction in viral load. A &amp;gt;3 log reduction was observed in 7 UVIG arms using a dose &amp;gt;40,000 J/m2. Impact of UVIG on fit was evaluated in one study (32,400 J/m2) and did not find evidence of compromise. Altogether, our findings suggest that further work in this area should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination.</p>"
OSF Preprints,10.31219/osf.io/6kpbg,NA,2020-03-18,Deep learning-based computational drug discovery to inhibit the RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase: application to SARS-CoV and COVID-19,"<p>There is an urgency to find drugs and vaccines for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therapeutic options include repurposing existing drugs or finding new ones. One approach is to target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and block viral RNA synthesis. Currently clinical trials to repurpose remdesivir, a RdRp targeting pro-drug for Ebola, to COVID-19 is under way. More such potential drugs need to be identified to efficiently find best therapeutic options. To address this need, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model from literature was trained to read the SMILES fingerprint of a molecule and predict the IC50 of the molecule when binding to an RdRp. This model was trained using IC50 binding data from the PDB database. 310,000 drug-like compounds from the ZINC database were then screened using the trained LSTM model. Additionally, the 310,000 molecules with their predicted IC50s were used to train a generative Semi-Supervised Variational AutoEncoder (SSVAE) model from literature. Although not trained by actual experimental data (sufficient data are not available), the SSVAE model was used to generate 10 new molecules by sampling from the latent space to demonstrate its utility. These 10 molecules and the 1025 molecules with the lowest predicted IC50s from the LSTM model were docked onto the SARS coronavirus (a virus similar to COVID-19) RdRp using AutoDock Vina. Top four most stable inhibitors from the screened ZINC database compounds had binding energies of less than -33.89 kJ/mol. These binding energies were less than the binding energies of the comparison group consisting of prior drugs remdesivir, favipiravir, and galidesivir. Among the ten new molecules generated by the SSVAE model, the most stable new molecule had binding energy lower than the comparison group of prior drugs. The low binding energies of these molecules indicate they could potentially be good drug candidates for the SARS CoV and COVID-19. These results also show the utility of deep learning-based models in screening existing compound and generating new molecules to find drugs for COVID-19.</p>"

There is a strong sense of Déjà vu as the world is caught flat footed without effective treatments to administer to patients. Our team has been actively involved in several small molecule drug discovery efforts for the preceding virus outbreaks. In 2014 we used machine learning to identify 3 new molecules to test for the Ebola virus and these were subsequently shown to be active in vitro and in vivo. We have also been involved in open science approaches that leverage the community to help. In 2016 we launched the OpenZika project as an IBM World Community Grid Project that used distributed computing power of volunteers to dock large numbers of compounds into Zika and related flavivirus targets. This led us into several collaborations in which we validated computational predictions in vitro. With both of these initiatives there was some knowledge of the virus, many compounds had already been tested in the case of Ebola, whereas for Zika initially all we had was the virus RNA sequence. In the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, this was a completely new virus and the scientists in China and elsewhere have started from scratch. In the space of a few weeks since the outbreak is acknowledged to have started, there are now compounds suggested as active in vitro and molecules repurposed in clinical trials. While this has been impressive, we propose there may still be gaps in our approach to drug discovery for such outbreaks.  There is an opportunity to repurpose additional approved drugs for this virus and we now suggest how these might be identified leveraging prior work on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other viruses. We also describe some of the immense challenges and limitations of the open antiviral drug discovery approaches we have been involved in.</p>"

One method of addressing the shortage is to decontaminate and re-use PPE. The Centres for Disease Control (CDC) specifically recommends N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) for healthcare workers who are interacting with patients with COVID-19. There are anecdotal reports and published literature evaluating the potential of using disinfectants, such as hydrogen peroxide and bleach to decontaminate FFRs, with mixed reports of impact on structural integrity.

Los Angeles has been one of the first cities in the United States to declare the state of emergency on March 4th, progressively issuing stronger policies involving (among the others) social distancing, the prohibition of crowded private and public gatherings and closure of leisure premises. These interventions highly disrupt and modify daily activities and habits, urban mobility and micro-level interactions between citizens. One of the many social phenomena that could be influenced by such measures is crime. Exploiting public data on crime in Los Angeles, and relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime, this work investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an impact on crime trends in a metropolis. The article specifically focuses on eight urban crime categories, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 16th 2020. The analyses will be updated bi-weekly to dynamically assess the shortand medium-term effects of these interventions to shed light on how crime adapts to such structural modification of the environment.

In the present, rapid classification of viruses, analysis of genome and screening for effective drugs are the most important tasks. In the present study, through literature review, sequence alignment, ORF identiﬁcation, motif recognition, secondary and tertiary structure prediction, the whole genome of coronavirus were comprehensively analyzed. In order to find effective drugs, the parameters of binding were calculated by SeeSAR. In addition, potential miRNAs were predicted according to RNA base-pairing. After prediction by NCBI, WebMGA and GeneMark, a total of 8 credible ORFs were detected. Even the whole genome have great difference with other CoVs, each ORF has high homology with SARS-CoVs (＞90%). Furthermore, domain composition in each ORFs was also similar to SARS. In DrugBank database, only 7 potential drugs were screened based on sequence search module. Further predicted binding sites between drug and ORFs revealed that 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid could bind 1# ORF in 4 different regions ideally. Meanwhile, 2 miRNAs (miR-1307-3p and miR-3613-5p) may be able to prevent virus replication or as biomarkers. In conclusion, the novel coronavirus may have consanguinity with SARS.

However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.Study design Rapid evidence review.Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak.Results: We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.</p>"

OSF Preprints,10.31219/osf.io/s7jwz,NA,2020-03-23,Hypothesis: Immunotherapy by Selective Convalescent Blood Engineering to stifle diseases like COVID-19,"<p>The current standard vaccine testing protocols takes nearly 10-24 months of testing before it is declared successful. Sometimes, by the time a successful vaccine is out for public use; the outbreak is already over. Can we afford such long testing protocols if humanity is struck with a deadly outbreak of novel Pathogen-X? With no vaccine or antiviral drug available to treat the infected—we are left with age old method of isolation, quarantine and rest, to arrest such a viral outbreak. However in the past it has been seen that doctors around the world used blood products from survivors which helped to reduce the mortality rate. Similar approaches using ‘Convalescent Blood Therapy or Plasma Therapy’ have been reported in treatment of viral outbreaks like Ebola. So what happens during a ‘Convalescent Blood Therapy’? While techniques like ‘Monoclonal antibody technique’ or ‘Covalent Plasma therapy’ – all focusses on administration of ‘antibodies’ from survivor to patient, it seems little attention is paid to generating mechanism of these antibodies. To understand more it is important we understand the blood components and study how each component plays its part in the Immune system. This paper explores the importance of each of these components and proposes a hypothesis on blood engineering to fight against diseases like COVID-19, Ebola etc. The anticipated advantages of the proposed technique outweigh the cost, time and efficiency of other available transfusion and vaccination processes. It is envisioned that in the future this new approach can serve as a quick emergency response system to subdue a pathogen outbreak and to stop it from becoming an epidemic/pandemic.</p>"

The prompt identification and sequencing of the COVID-19 genome has prompted herculean efforts to rapidly design and produce vaccines and other antiviral interventions. Nevertheless, the generalized availability of such therapeutics will be markedly out of phase with the first wave of this disease. Strategic drug repurposing combined with rapid testing of molecular targets could provide at least a pause in disease progression and aid mitigation. With respect to the current pandemic, COVID-19, in common with other enveloped viruses (e.g. HIV, Ebola, SARS, and MERS) encounter the endosomal/lysosomal host compartment as a critical step for infection and maturation. A surprisingly key interaction requires engagement of the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) pathway. This observation prompts the utilization of NPC1 inhibitors as antiviral agents. Fortunately, there are such molecules, in many cases available as generics that could be rapidly deployed in the upcoming months. Herein we expand upon this strategy and its scientific underpinning wherein given the biological conservation of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and the role of the NPC1-dependent late endosome/lysosome lipid pathway in coronavirus infections, we suggest that the known mechanistic information on NPC1 could be utilized within the context of COVID-19 and associated candidate therapeutics.</p>"

Although the virus is completely inactivated in the presence of known chemicals such as acetone and zinc it is by accessing the lungs that it manages to cause respiratory distress. The virus  is quite an amphiphilic molecule which makes its absorption easy to achieve particularly at an alveolar level where gas exchange occurs; however this amphilicity has been reached by mimicking human genome rather than by its own developmental sophistication. There is a wide range of therapeutic options for map kinase regulations. Some antimalarials and low dose aspirin even have demonstrated modest activity and according to recent news they have helped in difficult cases but prompt antiviral management should be addressed prior to the skyrocketing immune phase where the body may fail to recognise itself and self-attack.

To determine whether the lack of protection of lungs is a factor for the rapidly increasing infected population, we constructed a mask use model and analyzed how viral particles behavior. We found that mask can prevent viral particles from crossing it, reduce oxygen uptake efficiency, raise inlet air temperature, and increase resistance to breathing. We found that uninfected people should wear masks in any closed public building where viral particles from infected persons are expected to exist; that masks can dramatically aggravate disease severity on infected persons; that use of masks by infected persons is justified only if cross-infection and successive infections from external viral sources outweigh the expected harm; that people with unknown infection status should exercise due care. We further found at this point no fast measure can break the chain of infection, social distancing rule is insufficient, and wearing masks is the only effective remedy for interim protection. We found that World Health Organization’s rules on the use of masks are largely incorrect, and so are the rules of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. We predicted that those rules have dramatically increased severe infection incidence rate, and have made COVID disease of infected persons much severer.

We conducted a simulation depicting how predictive values vary in the face of unknown data surrounding test sensitivity, specificity, and reported cases. in the USA.   There are two main implications of our findings. First, the prevalence of COVID-19 in the tested population is likely inflated: clinical disease attributable to other sources of infection such as influenza, or other respiratory viruses, is a plausible explanation. Second, we should be less alarmed by not being able to trace chain of transmission for many who test positive early in this pandemic when population prevalence is low.</p>"

Vaccine development may not be straightforward, in part due to the the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).  The immune response to coronavirus infection or vaccination generates a mixture of IgG antibodies against viral surface proteins.  Many of these antibodies block viral infection.  However, in some cases IgG:virus complexes can facilitate viral entry and infection of cells by ADE, increasing the the risk and severity of infection.  This phenomenon occurs in SARS, MERS, HIV, Zika and dengue virus infection and vaccination; it has been a serious barrier to vaccine development for these infections.  Lack of high-affinity anti-COVID-19 IgG antibodies in children and younger adults may explain, in part, the decreased severity of infection in these groups.  Here, we discuss the evidence for ADE in the context of COVID-19 infection, and how it may affect development of a vaccine and convalescent serum therapies.

As of late March 2020, over 25,000 deaths and above a half million confirmed cases were registered across more than 175 countries or regions. The virus will infect a sizeable proportion of the worlds population, leading to unprecedented pressures on national health care systems. Although national estimates of hospital bed capacity are available, these obscure important differences at local and regional levels. COVID-19 appears especially dangerous for the oldest age groups and those with serious comorbidities. It is crucial to understand how health system capacity matches local variations in population structure. Using England and Wales, we illustrate how the interaction of local demography, a high burden of COVID-19 hospitalization at older ages, and regional variation in hospital resources may culminate in ""hospital deserts"" with too few resources to cope with a wave of critical cases. We demonstrate how local capacity could rapidly become overwhelmed. By providing fine-grained local estimates of expected hospitalization, we identify areas that have higher risks of health care burden. An online companion to this paper can be used by policymakers to identify and monitor high-risk areas, and predict the expected healthcare demand in real-time as the actual epidemic spreads. This agile knowledge will be invaluable to tackle the enormous logistical challenge COVID-19 will pose to health care systems.</p>"

However, data to inform optimal human dosing are limited. Methods: We conducted Monte Carlo simulations of HCQ sulfate using a published population pharmacokinetic model. The model informing our simulations described a 2-compartment linear model with first-order absorption with a lag, derived from plasma HCQ concentration data from 22 healthy adults and 69 patients with malaria. Using the final PK model, we performed 1000 simulations for the plasma concentrations of HCQ sulfate based on various approved dosages (i.e. acute malaria, autoimmune conditions) and proposed dosing regimens for treatment of COVID-19. The results of simulations were used to calculate area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for each evaluated regimen.Results: The use of a loading dose, as with acute malaria dosing, resulted in rapid achievement of maximal concentrations early in the treatment course, which were maintained with daily dosing thereafter. The use of once or twice daily doses without a loading dose led to slowly increasing plasma concentrations through day 10. Simulated regimens that employed an 800 mg loading dose for adults (13 mg/kg for children) followed by 400 mg at 6 or 12 hours (6.5 mg/kg for children) achieved the greatest AUC0-24.Conclusions: Based on our findings, along with established safety data from malarial studies, we believe that approved dosing for treatment acute malaria is the most reasonable and safest approach if HCQ will be used to treat COVID-19.</p>"

Using Bat CoV_RaTG13 Spike protein as reference (sharing 97% aa identity) the 4-amino acid insert can be identified as PRRA (AA position 681-684).  The effect of the 4-AA insertion is the presence of a furin signature sequence motif (PRRARSV) at the boundary of S1 and S2 domains of spike protein.   This sequence motif consists the required Arg residue for P1 and P4 position of Furin site.  In addition, it contains Arg at P3 site as well as Ser at P1’ site of furin motif.  This sequence motif matches Aerolysin furin site in FurinDB and was predicted to be moderately strong (score 0.62) by ProP, a protease cleavage site prediction program.  This finding suggests that the infectious 2019-nCoV virus, unlike SARS viruses, may be processed via cellular furin recognition and cleavage of the spike protein before host cell membrane fusion and entry.

Around tens of thousands of people have been infected. Some studies have demonstrated that the reason for the wider spread of COVID-19 was that SARS-CoV-2 presents a greater affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) than SARS-CoV. That means the number of ACE2 positive cells is related to the possibility of infection. The expression of ACE2 was mainly localized in the testis, heart, and kidney, but the expression landscape in testis is still unknown. Considering the critical roles of testicular cells for the transmission of genetic information between generations, more and more people are concerned about the effects of COVID-19 on the testis. In this study, we analyzed Single-cell RNA-seq datasets of the adult human testis. Results showed that ACE2 was expressed in both germ cells and somatic cells, among which Sertoli cells, Spermatogenic Stem cell, and Leydig cells are majority cluster. Moreover, we also found that the positive rate of ACE2 in testes of infertile men was higher than that of normal men, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may cause reproductive disorders through pathway activated by ACE2 and the men with reproductive disorder may more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our results also showed that the expression level of ACE2 was related to the age of men, and the peak of positive rate was at 30 years old, which indicates young men are more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Together, this research provides a biological background of the potential route for infection of SARS-CoV-2 and may enable rapid deciphering male-related reproductive disorders induced by COVID-19.</p>"

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This coronavirus disease has spread globally as a pandemic. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is established as a diagnostic assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in patient specimens. The increasing numbers of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great challenges for the test laboratories.Methods. The test specimens were collected by the hospitals or CDC in Hubei province. Viral RNA is extracted by manual column extraction and automated magnetic bead extraction method by MGISP-960 automated sample preparation system. qRT-PCR for the novel coronavirus is used in this process and several approaches were applied to prevent contamination and monitor process quality.Results. We introduced a high-throughput nucleic acid detection mode, Huo-Yan Laboratory, which has an automated process and rigorous quality control measures to ensure the stability and reliability of detection in large-scale specimens. The automated extraction method based on MGISP-960 sample preparation system has comparable results of manual extraction, and requires less time and personnel. The quality control monitoring results suggests that the quality control approaches in testing large-scale specimens are effective, and the test results are stable and reliable. Huo-Yan Laboratory mode can be flexibly adapted to the requirement of different throughput which is contributed to epidemic control in various places.</p>"

Then in 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from China resulting in the deaths of over 770 people. 10 years later, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged from Saudi Arabia, with MERS-CoV continuing to cause outbreaks and as of Nov 2019 resulting in a total of 2,494 confirmed cases in 27 countries with 858 fatalities. With CoVs now understood to be widespread through mammals tested around the globe, another spill-over event was inevitable if no precautions and importance was put on understanding the risks of this zoonotic disease spread. To date, more than 200 novel coronaviruses have been found in bats and ~35% of bat virome sequenced to date is composed of coronaviruses. Their and other mammals unique immune systems need to be the focus of future research with reports estimating mammal populations to harbour viruses in numbers up to 300 thousand. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is devastating with cases and deaths rising so rapidly that any number written would be out of date by time of publishing. Developing countries, war zones, refugee camps and those with a huge number of already immunocompromised patients such as the 25 million people in Africa living with HIV, will be decimated if the spread is not limited. Vaccines are beginning clinical trial phase and a huge global emphasis on interferon (IFN) research and drug development is underway. This will be necessary to control our unacceptable flu season fatalities and inevitable future pandemics. It is also crucial to understand that the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to maintain the barriers between natural reservoirs and human society, in mind of the ‘one health’ concept.

Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key host receptor has now been established as an important moiety for the entry of 2019-nCoV into the host cells.

Olfactory mucosa harbors multiple functionally distinct cell types. Zeroing in on the cell lineages that underpin infection associated loss of olfaction may provide new leads for diagnostics/clinical management of 2019-nCoV infected individuals. Our pointed bioinformatic analysis of single-cell expression profiles underscored selective expression of ACE2 in a subset of horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and sustentacular cells (SUSs) of the olfactory mucosa in humans.

OSF Preprints,10.31219/osf.io/6zy9u,NA,2020-03-21,Treatment of COVID-19 with Individualized Immune Boosting Interventions,"<p>There are major concerns regarding the current global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Whereas most of the infected individuals have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, in a small minority, the infection can lead to pneumonia and death. One major concern regarding the pandemic is the 2.3% average case fatality rate of the COVID-19 patients, with the fatality rate increasing to 8% for patients aged 70 to 79 and 14.8% for those aged 80 and over. Another major concern is the person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus by asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period, making it difficult to limit the spread of the disease. Many steps are underway worldwide to limit the spread of the disease, e.g. cancellation of conferences and large gatherings, closure of schools, curtailment of travel, etc. Considering the magnitude of the adverse impact on the social, cultural, commercial, educational, scientific, health, and other aspects of the society from such steps and the large anticipated casualties with the expected spread of the disease worldwide, it is important to explore methods of reducing the fatality rates of COVID-19 patients. Since the weakness of the immune system is one of the major contributing factors for the occurrence of pneumonia, and inflammation contributes to increased mortality rates of pneumonia patients, interventions that improve the immune response and/or reduce inflammation may reduce the pneumonia incidence and mortality in COVID-19 patients. There are indeed a large number of interventions that improve the immune response and/or reduce inflammation. However, all the interventions would not be applicable or acceptable to everyone and so the interventions would need to be individualized based on individual circumstances and preferences. This approach, known as “Individualized Interventions to Improve the Immune Response”, or the I4R approach needs to be tested in pilot clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. If the pilot clinical trials demonstrate that it is effective in reducing the incidence and mortality due to pneumonia, widespread adoption of the I4R approach for treating COVID-19 patients may reduce their morbidity and mortality, reducing the concerns regarding the coronavirus. This may be helpful in reducing the need for the drastic steps that have been taken worldwide, and help in the return of life to normalcy. Therefore, clinical trials of the I4R approach should be conducted on an urgent basis.</p>"

The only entry in GISAID from bats (BatCoV-RaTG13) is a mystery (it does not have any publications linked to it), but is very close to human 2019-nCoV. Mutations in the viral genome need to translate in changes in protein sequences (and function) in order modulate its virulence. This genomic fragment is in the N-terminal of the spike-protein (98-228), a known-epitope region and implicated in viral entry into host cells. Interestingly, this region also encodes a novel 87 novel protein, with a shifted open-reading frame (a phenomenon common in viruses).

One way to identify heterogeneous treatment effects is to conduct subgroup analyses, such as focusing on low-income Free School Meal pupils as required for projects funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) in England. These subgroup analyses, as we demonstrate in 48 EEF-funded RCTs involving over 200,000 students, are usually not standardised across studies and offer flexible degrees of freedom to researchers, potentially leading to mixed results. Here, we develop and deploy a machine-learning and regression-based framework for systematic estimation of Individualised Treatment Effect (ITE), which can show where a seemingly ineffective and uninformative intervention worked, for whom, and by how much.

HIV protease belongs to the aspartic protease family, whereas the two coronavirus proteases are from the cysteine protease family.

Preprints.org,10.20944/preprints202003.0319.v1,NA,2020-03-23,<em></em>Treatment of COVID-19 with Individualized Immune Boosting Interventions,"<jats:p>There are major concerns regarding the current global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Whereas most of the infected individuals have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, in a small minority, the infection can lead to pneumonia and death. One major concern regarding the pandemic is the 2.3% average case fatality rate of the COVID-19 patients, with the fatality rate increasing to 8% for patients aged 70 to 79 and 14.8% for those aged 80 and over. Another major concern is the person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus by asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period, making it difficult to limit the spread of the disease. Many steps are underway worldwide to limit the spread of the disease, e.g. cancellation of conferences and large gatherings, closure of schools, curtailment of travel, etc. Considering the magnitude of the adverse impact on the social, cultural, commercial, educational, scientific, health, and other aspects of the society from such steps and the large anticipated casualties with the expected spread of the disease worldwide, it is important to explore methods of reducing the fatality rates of COVID-19 patients. Since the weakness of the immune system is one of the major contributing factors for the occurrence of pneumonia, and inflammation contributes to increased mortality rates of pneumonia patients, interventions that improve the immune response and/or reduce inflammation may reduce the pneumonia incidence and mortality in COVID-19 patients. There are indeed a large number of interventions that improve the immune response and/or reduce inflammation. However, all the interventions would not be applicable or acceptable to everyone and so the interventions would need to be individualized based on individual circumstances and preferences. This approach, known as &amp;ldquo;Individualized Interventions to Improve the Immune Response&amp;rdquo;, or the I4R approach needs to be tested in pilot clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. If the pilot clinical trials demonstrate that it is effective in reducing the incidence and mortality due to pneumonia, widespread adoption of the I4R approach for treating COVID-19 patients may reduce their morbidity and mortality, reducing the concerns regarding the coronavirus. This may be helpful in reducing the need for the drastic steps that have been taken worldwide, and help in the return of life to normalcy. Therefore, clinical trials of the I4R approach should be conducted on an urgent basis.</jats:p>"

There are currently no drugs/ vaccines against the same and moreover limited diagnostic tests to identify the infection. Additionally, these tests are expensive and hence are exclusive for very highly suspected cases of the disease especially in developing countries. This is causing an under-diagnosis which is an alarming state of affairs, as even a single missed SARS-CoV 2 case would spread the disease exponentially and keep it in the community. Through this entirely in silico study, we have developed a cheaper and faster diagnostic method based on simple PCR and restriction enzyme digestion, commonly used in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) tests. Through comparative genomics, we found the closest neighbours of SARS-CoV 2 then found the highly conserved regions of the genome which were absent in SARS-CoV 1, its closest neighbour. Then we found restriction sites for various enzymes followed by designing of PCR primers flanking those sites. We have found the primer pair to produce a 401 bp amplicon and when digested by SwaI enzyme, it produces two fragments of lengths 216 bp and 185 bp. As an internal control, GAPDH primers are pooled with the SARS-CoV 2 primers as the patient sample will also include human RNA mixed with the viral RNA. This primer pair gives an amplicon of 131 bp and hence a negative sample should show a single band of 131 bp while a positive digested sample will give three bands of 401 bp, 216 bp and 131 bp. The primers are specific to SARS-CoV 2 only and can additionally be used for SYBR green based real time quantification of viral load. The developed tests have not yet been tested in vitro due to stressed out working hours in the only pathogenic virus handling laboratory in our institute. Nonetheless, this study works as a head start for other laboratories to rapidly test the suggested protocols in vitro and make available a cheaper alternative test for SARS-CoV 2 which would especially be beneficial for the lower to middle income countries.</jats:p>"

Proteases of SARS-CoV-2 are necessary for viral replication, structural assembly and pathogenicity. The ~33.8KDa Mpro protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a non-human homologue and highly conserved among several coronaviruses indicating Mpro could be a potential drug target for Coronaviruses.Methods: Here we performed computational ligand screening of four pharmacophores (OEW, Remdesivir, Hydroxycholoquine and N3) that are presumed to have positive effects against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease (6LU7) and also screened 50,000 molecules from the ZINC Database dataset against this protease target.Results: We found 40 pharmacophore-like structures of natural compounds from diverse chemical classes that exhibited better affinity of docking as compared to the known ligands. The 10 best selected ligands namely, ZINC1845382, ZINC1875405, ZINC2092396, ZINC2104424, ZINC44018332, ZINC2101723, ZINC2094526, ZINC2094304, ZINC2104482, ZINC3984030, and ZINC1531664, are mainly classified as &amp;beta;-carboline, Alkaloids and Polyflavonoids, and all of them displayed interactions with dyad CYS145 and HIS41 from the protease pocket in a similar way as with other known ligands.Conclusion: Our results suggest that these 10 molecules could be effective against SARS-CoV-2 protease and may be tested in vitro and in vivo to develop novel drugs against this virus.</jats:p>"

It is already clear now that its economic impact would be more severe that in the case of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003. Although not as deadly as SARS, coronavirus infection has a longer incubation period and leaves about 85% of the infected without any (or with just mild) symptoms which makes it more difficult to track and to contain. Moreover, it appears to be much more contagious than its predecessor. The goods news is that most people recover from the disease and develop antibodies that can protect them from getting infected again (natural vaccination). Those cured might become the key element for the post-virus recovery strategies of tourism organisations. People with the acquired immunity to the virus would be capable of travelling freely without spreading the disease. Airlines, hotels and gastronomy should aim at this group offering them discounts and special offers. However, the problem is how to effectively ensure that everyone who claims to be cured from COVID-19 is telling the truth. Health tracking bracelets, apps, and other advanced technological solutions should be put in place. Recent best practices from Hong Kong, mainland China, or India might be applied.</jats:p>"

Recent studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share around 80% of homology and use the same cell entry receptor, ACE2. These inspired us to study other receptors of SARS-CoV, which may be used for SARS-CoV-2 binding as well. In this study, we screened the gene expression of three receptors (ACE2, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) in four datasets of normal lung tissue from lung adenocarcinoma patients and two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from normal lung and bronchial epithelial cells separately. No significant difference in gene expression of these three receptors were found between gender groups (male vs female). We found higher gene expression of DC-SIGN in elder with age&amp;gt;60 and higher gene expression of L-SIGN in Caucasian than Asian. Similar to ACE2, we observed significantly higher DC-SIGN gene expression in the lungs of smokers, especially former smokers. However, smokers upregulate ACE2 and DC-SIGN gene expression in different cell types. In the whole lung, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodeled Alveolar Type II cells of former smokers, while DC-SIGN is largely expressed in monocytes of former smokers and dendritic cells of current smokers. In bronchial epithelium, no obvious gene expression of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN was observed while ACE2 was found to be actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In conclusion, our findings may indicate that smokers, especially former smokers, and people over 60 have higher risk and are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, this study provides hints on possible SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity mechanisms in lung infection.</jats:p>"

In this urgency situation, development of SARS-CoV-2 based vaccines is immediately required. Immunoinformatic and molecular modelling are generally used time-efficient methods to accelerate the discovery and design of the candidate peptides for vaccine development. In recent years, the use of multiepitope vaccines is proved to be a promising immunization strategy against viruses and pathogens, which induce more comprehensive protective immunity.

In this study, we analyzed the high-resolution Cryo-EM structure of Spike glycoproteins. The results showed that electron densities of glycans cover most of the SARS-CoV Spike receptor binding domain except FSPDGKPCTPPALNCYWPLNDYGFYTTTGIGYQ. The glycosylated 2019-nCoV Spike protein by homology structure modeling showed a similar exposed sequence YQAGSTPCNGVEGFNCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGYQ. Other surface-exposed domains included those located on Central Helix, between amino acids 967 and 1016 of SARS-CoV, and 985 to 1034 of 2019-nCoV Spike protein.  As the majority of antibody paratopes bind to peptide portion with or without sugar modification, we propose a snake-catcher model that a minimal length of peptide is first clamped by a paratope, and the binding is either strengthened by sugars close to peptide, or not interfered by sugar modification.</jats:p>"

It is confused that ACE2 is widely expressed across a variety of organs and is expressed moderately but not highly in lung, which, however, is the major infected organ. It remains unclear why it is the lung but not other tissues among which ACE2 highly expressed is mainly infected. We hypothesized that there could be some other genes playing key roles in the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells. Here we found that AGTR2 (angiotensin II receptor type 2), a G-protein coupled receptor, has interaction with ACE2 and is highly expressed in lung with a high tissue specificity. More importantly, simulation of 3D structure based protein-protein interaction reveals that AGTR2 shows a higher binding affinity with the Spike protein of 2019-nCov than ACE2 (energy score: -15.7 vs. -6.9 [kcal/mol]). Given these observations, we suggest that AGTR2 could be a putative novel gene for the the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells but need further confirmation by biological experiments. Finally, a number of compounds, biologics and traditional Chinese medicine that could decrease the expression level of AGTR2 were predicted.</jats:p>"

By February 26, 2020, over 80,000 people were infected and 2,814 died from the infection. The initial route of infection is the binding of the spike protein (S protein) of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). From bioinformatics analysis, we found that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 produced an evolutionary mutation of K403R compared with the S protein of SARS-CoV, forming an adjacent RGD motif at the interaction surface. As the RGD motif is considered as a ligand for many cell surface integrins, we proposed that the binding of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with integrins may facilitate the infection process of the virus. Therefore, high-throughput virtual screening was performed by choosing the key residues of S protein interface of SARS-CoV-2 and the adjacent RGD motif as potential binding site, to search for the potential agents targeting interaction of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with both ACE2 and integrins as potential therapeutic drugs. Various libraries including the FDA-approved drugs etc. were screened, and Nadide, Losartan, 9'''-Methyllithospermate B and Leonurine etc. were identified as representative potential drugs candidate for COVID-19.</jats:p>"

Bats were considered as the reservoir host, and the search of a probable intermediate host is still going on. Animals have anticipated culprit of SARS-CoV-2 as of now. The disease is mainly manifested by pneumonia and related respiratory signs and symptoms, but the involvement of the gastrointestinal system and nervous system is also suggested. The severe form of the disease associated with death is mainly reported in older and immune-compromised patients with pre-existing disease history. Death in severe cases is attributed to respiratory failure associated with hyperinflammation. Cytokine storm syndrome associated with rampant inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered as the leading killer of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients were reported with higher levels of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines like IFN-g, IL-1b, IP-10, and MCP-1. Furthermore, severe cases of COVID-19 revealed higher levels of TNF-&amp;alpha;, G-CSF, and MIP-1A. Blood profile of the COVID-19 patients exhibits lymphopenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and RNAaemia along with increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women does not lead to fetus mortalities unlike other zoonotic coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with no evidence of intrauterine transmission to neonates. Rapid and confirmatory diagnostics have been developed, and high efforts are being made to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. In the absence of any virus-specific therapeutic, internationally health care authorities are recommending adoption of effective prevention and control measures to counter and contain this pandemic virus. This paper is an overview of this virus and the disease with a particular focus on SARS-COV-2 / COVID-19 clinical pathology, pathogenesis and immunopathology along with a few recent research developments.</jats:p>"

These containment efforts often lead to changes in the contact pattern among individuals of the population. Many existing compartmental epidemic models fail to account for the effects of contact structure. In this paper, we devised a pairwise epidemic model to analyze the COVID-19 outbreak in China based on confirmed cases reported during the period February 3rd--17th, 2020. By explicitly incorporating the effects of family clusters and contact tracing followed by household quarantine and isolation, our model provides a good fit to the trajectory of COVID-19 infections and is useful to predict the epidemic trend. We obtained the average of the reproduction number $R=1.494$ ($95\%$ CI: $1.483-1.507$) for Hubei province and $R=1.178$ ($95\%$ CI: $1.145-1.158$) for China (except Hubei), suggesting that some existing studies may have overestimated the reproduction number by neglecting the dynamical correlations and clustering effects. We forecasted that the COVID-19 epidemic would peak on February 13th ($95\%$ CI: February $9-17$th) in Hubei and 6 days eariler in the regions outside Hubei. Moreover the epidemic was expected to last until the middle of March in China (except Hubei) and late April in Hubei. The sensitivity analysis shows that ongoing exposure for the susceptible and population clustering play an important role in the disease propagation. With the enforcement of household quarantine measures, the reproduction number $R$ effectively reduces and epidemic quantities decrease accordingly. Furthermore, we gave an answer to the public concern on how long the stringent containment strategies should maintain. Through numerical analysis, we suggested that the time for the resumption of work and production in China (except Hubei) and Hubei would be the middle of March and the end of April, 2020, respectively. These constructive suggestions may bring some immeasurable social-economic benefits in the long run.</jats:p>"

The viral main protease (3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine enzyme) controls COVID-19 duplication and manages its life cycle, making it a drug discovery target. Therefore, herein, we analyzed the theoretical approaches of 10 structurally different hydrolysable tannins as natural anti-COVID-19 through binding with the main protease of 2019-nCoV using molecular docking modelling via Molecular Operating Environment (MOE v2009) software. Our results revealed that there are top three hits may serve as potential anti-COVID-19 lead molecules for further optimization and drug development to control COVID-19.

Here, we test this possibility with the lung expression of ACE2, which encodes the cell-entry receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We show that ACE2 expression is not affected during tumorigenesis, suggesting that the transcriptome data from the more than 1000 lung cancer samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) can be used to study ACE2 expression among people without cancer. The expression of ACE2 increases with age, but is not associated with sex. Asians show a similar ACE2 expression to other races. Furthermore, the frequencies of ACE2 alleles in Asians are not significantly deviated from those in other races. These observations indicate that individuals of all races need the same level of personal protection against SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

To date well-established therapeutics modules for infected patients are unknown. In this present initiative, molecular interactions between well-known antiviral drugs against the Hepatitis-C virus (HCV) have been investigated theoretically against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. HCV and SARS-CoV-2 are both +ssRNA viruses. At 25o C beclabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the RdRp of the HCV can efficiently bind to RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 (&amp;Delta;GAutoDock = -9.95 kcal mol-1) with an inhibition constant of only 51.03 nM. Both the &amp;Delta;GLondon and &amp;Delta;GGBVI / WSA values were - 9.06 and - 6.67 kcal mol-1, respectively for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, beclabuvir also shows better binding free energy (&amp;Delta;Gvina = 9.7 kcal mol-1) than that of the Thumb 1 domain of RdRp of HCV (&amp;Delta;Gvina = 7.7 kcal mol-1). InterProScan has suggested the RNA-directed 5'-3' polymerase activity existed within 549 to 776 amino acid residues of RdRp. Moreover, major interacting amino acid residues were I591, Y621, C624, D625, A690, N693, L760, D762, D763 and E813-N817. Molecular interaction suggests occupancy of beclabuvir inside the active site environment of the RdRp which is essential for viral RNA synthesis. In conclusion, results suggest beclabuvir has high therapeutic potential as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug.</jats:p>"

Remdesivir was reported by World Health Organization (WHO) as the most promising drug currently available for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In the absence of a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, we first construct the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identify of 95.8%). We then build the putative binding mode by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp. The putative binding structure is further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations and demonstrated to be stable, indicating a reasonable binding mode for remdesivir. The relative binding free energy of remdesivir is calculated to be -8.28 &amp;plusmn; 0.65 kcal/mol, much stronger than the natural substrate ATP (-4.14 &amp;plusmn; 0.89 kcal/mol) which is needed for the polymerization. The ~800-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of APT in blocking of the RdRp binding pocket. Key residues D618, S549 and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings demonstrate that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA reproduction, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.</jats:p>"

Previous studies showed that some virus could affect the reproductive system and cause long-term complications. Recent studies exploring the source of SARS-CoV-2 using genomic sequencing have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), the receptor that recognizes SARS-CoV. To investigate the expression of ACE2 and to explore the potential risk of infection in the reproductive system, we performed a thorough bioinformatic analysis on data from public databases involving RNA expression, protein expression, and single-cell RNA expression studies. The analyzed data showed high levels of ACE2 mRNA and protein expression in the testis and spermatids and equal levels of ACE2 expression in the uterus and lung. Comprehensive single-cell analysis identified ACE2 expression in the lung, testis, spermatids, and uterus. In conclusion, this study revealed the potential risk associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the reproductive system and predicted that long-term complications might have a significant impact on the prevention and management of COVID-19, the disease caused upon infection with SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>"

Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of confirmed cases of COVID-19. All the observational studies, and also case reports, were included. The case reports were analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95%CI. Measures of heterogeneity, including Cochran&amp;rsquo;s Q statistic, the I2 index, and the &amp;tau;2 test, were estimated and reported.Results: 660 articles were retrieved.

Recently, a new type of viral infection has emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus does not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes such as food-borne transmission should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows a less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases. Compared to other emerging viruses such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus may have been transferred from an animal source such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended.</jats:p>"

We found strong similarities between the current circulating COVID-19 and SARS and MERS, as well as COVID-19 in rhinolophines and pangolins. On the contrary, COVID-19 shares little similarity with the flu-causing coronaviruses and the other P3/P4 viruses. Strikingly, we observed divergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increased from December 2019 to March 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is actively evolving in human hosts. From all existing human COVID-19 genome sequences, we calculated the first common model that represents the shared sequences of the human COVID-19 strains, which provides important information for vaccine and antibody development.

The overlapped gene sets were enriched and the selected genes were constructed for protein-protein interaction networks. Through interactome, key genes were identified for COVID-19 and also for high risk and asymptomatic groups. The key hub genes involved in COVID-19 were VEGFA, TNF, IL-6, CXCL8, IL10, CCL2, IL1B, TLR4, ICAM1, MMP9. The identified key genes were used for drug-gene interaction for drug repurposing. The chloroquine, lenalidomide, pentoxifylline, thalidome, sorafenib, pacitaxel, rapamycin, cortisol, statins were proposed to be probable drug repurposing candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. However, these predicted drug candidates need to be validated through randomized clinical trials. Also, a key gene involved in high risk and the asymptomatic group were identified, which can be used as probable biomarkers for early identification.</jats:p>"

These problems must be faced on the one hand by acting on the oral health prevention methods, and on the other by implementing specific protocols relating both to the conditions of oral pathologies that normally do not represent an emergency, and to those clinical situations that fall into the category of pediatric dental emergencies. In this perspective, in addition to defining rigorous and highly effective infection control protocols in the dental settings, it is of fundamental importance to work on remote communication and education aimed at maintaining the oral health of the children. This article, after an analysis of the risk factors from COVID-19 associated with pediatric dental treatment, presents a series of considerations on potential oral prevention strategies and on the management of emergency and non-emergency dental procedures in a context of disease transmission control, proposing new approaches and models of treatment based also on remote interaction techniques which will then retain their usefulness even at the end of the current emergency period.</jats:p>"

Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, or lateral flow assay detection. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing coronoviral nCov-2019 infection) urgently need the developing of express-diagnostic tools. Recently devised CRISPR-technologies represent the unprecedented opportunity to reshape epidemiological surveillance and molecular diagnostics.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, there is no drug to combat the virus. It is of high significance to develop a drug that can combat the virus effectively before the situation gets worse. It usually takes a much longer time to develop a drug using traditional methods. For 2019-nCoV, it is now better to rely on some alternative methods to develop drugs that can combat such a disease effectively since 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to SARS-CoV. In this paper, we first collected virus RNA sequences from the GISAID database, translated the RNA sequences into protein sequences, and built a protein 3D model using homology modeling. Coronavirus main protease is considered to be a major therapeutic target, thus this paper focused on drug screening based on the modeled 2019-nCov_main_protease structure. The deep learning based method DFCNN, developed by our group, can identify/rank the protein-ligand interactions with relatively high accuracy. DFCNN is capable of performing virtual screening quickly since no docking or molecular dynamic simulation is needed. DFCNN identifies potential drugs for 2019-nCoV protease by performing drug screening against 4 chemical compound databases. Also, we performed drug screening for all tripeptides against the binding site of 2019-nCov_main_protease since peptides often show better stability, more bio-availability and negligible immune responses. In the end, we provided the list of possible chemical ligands and peptide drugs for experimental validation.</jats:p>"

In the absence of any antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies, the disease is spreading at an alarming rate. A clinical trial to evaluate an anti-COVID-19 vaccine has started recently. However, its efficacy and potency have to be evaluated and validated. As an alternative, we are presenting a designed multi-peptide subunit based epitope vaccine against COVID-19. The vaccine is non-toxic, non-allergenic, thermostable and immunogenic with the capability to elicit a humoral and cell-mediated immune response. The findings are validated with high-end computation-based methods. This unique vaccine is made up of 33 highly antigenic epitopes from three proteins that have a prominent role in host receptor recognition, viral entry, and pathogenicity.

The regulation of the ACE2 gene that codes for COVID-19 host receptor ACE2 has been shown to be under epigenetic regulation. Here, we examined whether intensive DNA methylation profiling of the ACE2 gene differed by human host tissue and cell type, gender, and age. Results: Accessing four public datasets, we observed unique human cell-type-specific ACE2 DNA methylation patterns. In human lung tissues, gender differences in DNA methylation at 2 sites related to the ACE2 gene were identified. Further, in freshly isolated airway epithelial cells, DNA methylation near the transcription start site of the ACE2 gene associated with biological age. Conclusion: Epigenetic profiling of host tissue may permit discovery of age and gender-related potential risk factors for COVID-19.

However, so far, no effective drugs or vaccines have been developed. Whereas, the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been considered as a promising supplementary treatment for the disease owing to its clinically proven performance on many diseases even like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Meanwhile, many side-effect (SE) reports suggest the SE of the TCM prescriptions cannot be ignored in curing the COVID-19, especially because COVID-19 always simultaneously leads to dramatic degradation of the patients&amp;rsquo; physical condition. How to evaluate the TCM regarding to their latent SE is a urgent challenge. Aim of the study: In this study, we use an ontology-based side-effect prediction framework (OSPF) developed in our previous work and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based deep learning to evaluate the TCM prescriptions that are officially recommended in China for novel coronavirus (COVID-19).  Materials and methods: Firstly, we adopted the OSPF developed in our previous work, where an ontology-based model separate all the ingredients in a TCM prescription into two categories: hot and cold. Then, we established a database by converting each TCM prescription into a vector containing the ingredient dosage and the according hot/cold attribution as well as the safe/unsafe label. And, we trained the ANN model using this database, after which a safety indicator (SI), as the complementary percentage of side-effect (SE) possibility, is then given for each TCM prescription. According to the proposed SI from high to low, we re-organize the recommended prescription list. Secondly, by using this method, we also evaluate the safety indicators of some other famous TCM prescriptions that are not in the recommended list but are used traditionally to cure flu-like diseases for extending the potential treatments.  Results: Based on the SI generated in the ANN model, FTS, PMSP, and SF are the safest ones in recommended list, which all own a more-than-0.8 SI. Whereas, JHQG, LHQW, SFJD, XBJ, and SHL are the prescriptions that are most likely unsafe, where the indicators are all below 0.2. In the extra list, the indicators of XC, XQRS, CC, and CHBX are all above 0.8, and at the meantime, XZXS, SJ, QW, and KBD&amp;rsquo;s indicators are all below 0.2. Conclusions: In total, there are seven TCM prescriptions which own the indicators more than 0.8, suggesting these prescriptions should be considered firstly in curing COVID-19, if suitable. We believe this work will provide a reasonable suggestion for the society to choose proper TCM as the supplementary treatment for COVID-19. Besides, this work also introduces a pilot and enlightening method for creating a more reasonable recommendation list of TCM to other diseases.</jats:p>"

As of today, there exist no approved treatments against COVID-19. Vaccines are being developed, but they will take time, at least one year, to reach the population. Drug repositioning represents a fast track because already approved medicines have been broadly tested through multiple trials. We developed a repositioning strategy that mostly leads to candidates that are commonly used. The advantages are that they will facilitate proof of concept in humans through a &amp;ldquo;real-world evidence&amp;rdquo; approach and should be rapidly available to the population. We focus on the established research results that the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy pathways of the host cells are essential to the life cycle of previously known coronaviruses. We performed the relevant bioinformatics analysis to understand and confirm if SARS-CoV-2 may interact with these druggable pathways. Based on these considerations, we prioritized two additional druggable pathways, which are important to the viral life cycle and tightly connected to UPR/autophagy signaling: the mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP) and NLRP-3 inflammasome pathways. These four important pathways are perturbed in most major common diseases and have therefore been targeted by numerous broadly prescribed drugs. We have identified 97 approved drugs that are known to modulate these four identified pathways, and which represent, therefore, interesting repositioning candidates. Although it is indisputable that these drugs should never be used for immediate self-medication against COVID-19, we notice that some of them could also be prescribed to individuals who have COVID-19 comorbidities (e.g., hypertension). It is debated if these comorbidities are linked to the pathology itself (e.g., hypertension) or the drugs used to treat the pathology (e.g., sartans). Therefore, relevant preclinical tests and massive electronic health records (i.e., real-world evidence) must be used to pre-screen them and check the COVID-19 prognosis of individuals taking these drugs.</jats:p>"

It is suggested that these candidate &amp;ldquo;drug-like compounds&amp;rdquo; have greater potential to stop the replication of SARS-CoV-2, hence might lead to the cure of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

The human to human transmission of this virus has also been established. Untill now the virus has infected more than seven thousand people and has spread to fifteen countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared 2019-nCoV as global health emergency due to its outburst well beyond China. There is need to develop some vaccines or therapeutics to control or prevent 2019-nCoV infections. The bottleneck with current conventional approaches is that these require longer time for vaccine development. However, computer assisted approaches help us to produce effective vaccine in short time compared with conventional methods. In this study, bioinformatics analysis was used to predict B cell and T cell epitopes of surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV that could be suitable to trigger significant immune response. The sequence of surface glycoprotein was collected from the database and analyzed to identify the immunogenic epitope. Both B cell and T cell epitopes were analyzed so the predicted epitopes can stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses. We predicted 13 B cell and 05 T cell epitopes that later on were joined with GPGPG linker to make a single peptide. This computational approach to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against emerging 2019-nCoV allows us to find novel immunogenic epitopes against the antigen targets of surface 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. This multi epitope peptide vaccine may prove effective to combat 2019-nCoV infections.</jats:p>"

The COVID-19 Main Proteases play very important role in the propagation of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). It has already killed more than 8000 people around the world and thousands of people are getting infected every day. Therefore, it is very important to identify a potential inhibitor against COVID-19 Main Proteases to inhibit the propagation of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). We have applied a drug repurposing approach of computational methodology, depending on the synergy of molecular docking and virtual screening techniques, aimed to identify possible potent inhibitors against Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from FDA approved antiviral compounds and from the library of active phytochemicals. On the basis of recently resolved COVID-19 Main Protease crystal structure (PDB:6LU7), the library of 100 FDA approved antiviral compounds and 1000 active components of Indian Medicinal Plants extracted for screening against COVID-19 Main Protease. The compounds were further screened using Pyrex virtual screening tool and then best inhibitors, top 19 compounds optimally docked to the COVID-19 Main Protease structure to understand the participation of specific amino acids with inhibitors at active sites. Total 19 best compounds were identified after screening based on their highest binding affinity with respect to the other screened compounds. Out of 19, 6 best compounds were further screened based on their binding affinity and best ADME properties. Nelfinavir exhibited highest binding energy -8.4 kcal/mol and strong stability with the TRP207, ILE281, LEU282, PHE3, PHE291, GLN127, ARG4, GLY283, GLU288, LYS5, LYS137, TYR126, GLY138, TYR126, SER139 and VAL135 amino acid residues of COVID-19 Main Protease participating in the interaction at the binding pocket. In addition to Nelfinavir (-8.4), Rhein (-8.1), Withanolide D (-7.8), Withaferin A (-7.7), Enoxacin (-7.4), and Aloe-emodin (-7.4) also showed good binding affinity and best ADME properties. Our findings suggest that these compounds can be used as potential inhibitors against COVID-19 Main Protease, which could be helpful in inhibiting the propagation of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). Moreover, further in vitro and in vivo validation of these findings would be very helpful to bring these inhibitors to next level study.</jats:p>"

Unexpectedly, an influenza-like illness (ILI) is also caused in Patient 3 having close contact with Patient 1 at personal dinner party. Combined with clinical and epidemiological study, chest computed tomography (CT) and molecular diagnosis demonstrate that all the three cases tested positive for COVID-19 with distinct symptoms by human-to-human transmission.

COVID-19 has become a global pandemic since its outbreak at the end of Dec 2019. COVID-19 could lead to severe acute respiratory disease, especially to those who have reduced immunity. Binding of the viral Spike protein (S) to its receptor ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) on the surface of target cells has been proven to be key for virus entry and infection. Although ACE2 expression in the respiratory system is necessary for pneumonia infection by SARS-CoV-2, the regulation of ACE2 gene expression remains poorly investigated, especially for patients that are in pre-pathological conditions. Here, by analyzing The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we investigated the expression regulation of ACE2 in various kinds of primary epithelial cells from the respiratory system after influenza A or respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection. Our analyses reveal that infection of influenza A, RSV or influenza vaccines greatly increased ACE2 expression, suggesting that influenza viral infection could represent a high risk factor for developing COVID-19. We also found that the regulatory effect of influenza A virus on ACE2 expression is associated with activation of the interferon beta-induced pathway and viral RNA-activated host response. Together, our data provide a theoretical framework for clinical classification for SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility and could be used for future prevention and therapy treatment for COVID-19.</jats:p>"

In this study, the coronavirus pathogenicity and the losartan functional ligand for inhibiting TRPM2 and macrodomain have been molecularly evaluated.Material and method: In this study, the structures of macrodomain binding ADP ribose in CoVs and human Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 2 (TRPM2) protein were downloaded from protein data bank. Then, a virtual screening was done to recognize the hit compounds from GalaXi_2019-10, KnowledgeSpace_2019-05, and REALspace_2019-12 databases. This collection, then, was imported to the ligandScout software, on the base of Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose (ADPR) pharmacophore model. Result: Among seven compounds, five compounds were finally evaluated as the structural analogs of ADPR or other nucleotides, from which one compound was a non-FDA-approved sulphonamide and was removed. The other compound, losartan, was finally selected for molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation. According to the virtual screening and docking, losartan was candidate as an effective ligand for TRPM2 and macrodomain. Conclusion: In the current study losartan earned a proper dock score and binding affinity to create the complexes with TRPM2 and macrodomain. The inhibitory effect of losartan on PARP has been shown and it could interfere positively in several points (PARP, PARG- macrodomain and TRPM2) and decreases oxidative stress and apoptosis in COVID-19.   </jats:p>"

Already in the past, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 demonstrates the potential of coronaviruses to cross-species borders and further underlines the importance of identifying new-targeted drugs. An ideal antiviral agent should target essential proteins involved in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV. Currently, some HIV protease inhibitors (i.e., Lopinavir) are proposed for the treatment of COVID-19, although their effectiveness was not yet assessed. The main protease (Mpro) provides a highly validated pharmacological target for the discovery and design of inhibitors. We identified potent Mpro inhibitors employing computational techniques that entail the screening of a Marine Natural Product (MNP) library. MNP library was screened by hyphenated pharmacophore model, and molecular docking approaches. Molecular dynamics and re-docking further confirmed the results obtained by structure-based techniques and allowed to highlight some crucial aspects. Seventeen potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors have been identified among the natural substances of marine origin. As these compounds were extensively validated by a consensus approach and by molecular dynamics, the likelihood that at least one of these compounds could be bioactive is excellent.</jats:p>"

However, little is known about the host genetics interaction with infection and COVID-19 progression. To better understand the role of host genetics, we review the current literature, aggregate readily available genetic resources, and provide some updated analysis relevant to COVID-19 and associated phenotypes. Using the unrelated individuals in UK Biobank (total n = 337,579 across 5 populations), we aggregate human leukocyte antigen and ABO blood type frequencies. We find significant and consistent risk reduction of blood group O reported in Zhao et al. and encourage broad sharing of ABO blood type frequencies that are readily accessible across COVID-19 with mild, moderate, and severe/critical symptoms for robust inferences at https://tinyurl.com/abo-covid19. In addition, we generate polygenic risk scores (PRSs) weights for 29 blood measurements, including clinically relevant haematological measurements for COVID-19, such as lymphocyte count and percentage. Focusing on the 8 most COVID-19 clinically relevant blood measurements, we performed PRS-PheWAS analysis across 44 disease antigen measurements (n = 6,643 unrelated individuals in White British group), infectious diseases and acute respiratory infections (n = 20,928 cases and 349,000 controls across 3 population groups) and deaths (n = 1,846 cases and 368,082 controls), recorded in hospital inpatient record and death registry data, respectively, in UK Biobank, and find host genetic PRS associations with disease risk.

In this study, we investigated the effect of far infrared (FIR) radiation on inhibition of airborne microorganisms. The result confirmed that double stand DNA from airborne microorganisms were stable under mild FIR radiation. However, single strand RNA from them was found to be sensitive to FIR radiation, indicating that RNA virus in airborne particles is instable under FIR radiation. Based on this observation, two models on usage of FIR radiation to prevent RNA virus transmission and cure RNA virus infection were proposed, implying that FIR radiation might be a cheap, convenient, and efficient method in clinic to treat RNA virus.</jats:p>"

More severe forms of COVID-19 present as clinical severe acute respiratory syndrome, but include a T-predominant lymphopenia3, high circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in lungs, and immune dysregulation including immunosuppression4.  Methods: All major SARS-CoV-2 proteins were characterized using an amino acid residue variation analysis method. Results predict that most SARS-CoV-2 proteins are evolutionary constrained, with the exception of the spike (S) protein extended outer surface. Results were interpreted based on known SARS-like coronavirus virology and pathophysiology, with a focus on medical countermeasure development implications.  Findings: Non-neutralizing antibodies to variable S domains may enable an alternative infection pathway via Fc receptor-mediated uptake. This may be a gating event for the immune response dysregulation observed in more severe COVID-19 disease. Prior studies involving vaccine candidates for FCoV5,6 SARS-CoV-17-10 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 11 demonstrate vaccination-induced antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE), including infection of phagocytic antigen presenting cells (APC). T effector cells are believed to play an important role in controlling coronavirus infection; pan-T depletion is present in severe COVID-19 disease3 and may be accelerated by APC infection. Sequence and structural conservation of S motifs suggests that SARS and MERS vaccine ADE risks may foreshadow SARS-CoV-2 S-based vaccine risks. Autophagy inhibitors may reduce APC infection and T-cell depletion12 13. Amino acid residue variation analysis identifies multiple constrained domains suitable as T cell vaccine targets. Evolutionary constraints on proven antiviral drug targets present in SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 may reduce risk of developing antiviral drug escape mutants.  Interpretation: Safety testing of COVID-19 S protein-based B cell vaccines in animal models is strongly encouraged prior to clinical trials to reduce risk of ADE upon virus exposure.</jats:p>"

The role of animals as potential reservoirs for such pathogens remains an unanswered question. No systematic reviews have been published on this topic to date. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in animals and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalences and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Results: 6,493articles were retrieved (1960-2019). After screening by abstract/title, 50articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of them, 42 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From a total of 34 studies (n=20,896 animals), the pool prevalence by RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was 7.2% (95%CI 5.6-8.7%), with 97.3% occurring in camels, in which pool prevalence was 10.3% (95%CI 8.3-12.3). Qatar was the country with the highest MERS-CoV RT-PCR pool prevalence, 32.6% (95%CI 4.8-60.4%). From 5 studies and 2,618 animals, for SARS-CoV, the RT-PCR pool prevalence was 2.3% (95%CI 1.3-3.3). Of those, 38.35% were reported on bats, in which the pool prevalence was 14.1% (95%CI0.0-44.6%). Discussion: A considerable proportion of infected animals tested positive, particularly by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), an essential condition that highlights the relevance of individual animals as reservoirs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In this meta-analysis, camels and bats were found to be positive by RT-PCR in over 10% of the cases for both; thus, suggesting their relevance in the maintenance of wild zoonotic transmission.</jats:p>"

In this time of health crisis, it is the duty of scientific research community to provide alternative, effective and affordable strategies to vaccinate human bodies against viral infections-COVID-19 based on focused experimental approaches. Growing evidence suggests that certain natural foods and lifestyle changes have potential to optimize immune functions against viral infections including improving defense function, resistance towards invading pathogens, while maintaining self-tolerance.

This review presents the six smart steps to add to your to-do list which let the inner work of immunity take place against viral infections-COVID-19 by dissolving the powers of disease and illness. Many of these factors are associated in their functions to improve or properly maintain the immune function such as promoting anti-inflammatory functions, inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators, modulating cell-mediated immunity, altering the antigen-presenting cellular functions as well as promoting communication between the innate and adaptive immune responses.

While novel drug discovery and vaccine studies are long, repurposing old drugs against the COVID-2019 epidemic can help identify treatments, with known preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity profiles, which can rapidly enter Phase 3 or 4 or can be used directly in clinical settings. In this study, we presented a novel network based drug repurposing platform to identify potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-2019. We first analysed the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and identified SARS as the closest disease, based on genome similarity between both causal viruses, followed by MERS and other human coronavirus diseases. Using our AutoSeed pipeline (text mining and database searches), we obtained 34 COVID-2019-related genes. Taking those genes as seeds, we automatically built a molecular network for which our module detection and drug prioritization algorithms identified 24 disease-related human pathways, five modules and finally suggested 78 drugs to repurpose.

The evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronaviruses is unclear. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae.Methods: A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae.Results: Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model.

In past years, highly infectious coronavirus-induced diseases, including COVID-19, SARS, and MERS, have resulted in world-wide severe infections. Our literature annotations identified 72 chemical drugs and 27 antibodies effective against at least one human coronavirus infection in vitro or in vivo. Many of these drugs inhibit viral entry to cells and viral replication inside cells or modulate host immune responses. Many antimicrobial drugs, including antimalarial (e.g., chloroquine and mefloquine) and antifungal (e.g., terconazole and rapamycin) drugs as well as antibiotics (e.g., teicoplanin and azithromycin) were associated with anti-coronavirus activity. A few drugs, including remdesivir, chloroquine phosphate, favipiravir, and tocilizumab, have already been reported to be effective in treating COVID-19. After mapping our identified drugs to three ontologies ChEBI, NDF-RT, and DrON, many features such as roles and mechanisms of action (MoAs) of these drugs were identified and categorized. For example, out of 35 drugs with MoA annotations in NDF-RT, 34 have MoAs of different types of inhibitors and antagonists. Two clustering analyses, one based on ChEBI-based semantic similarity, the other based on drug chemical similarity, were performed to cluster over 60 drugs to new categories. Moreover, PCA analysis of anti-coronavirus drugs found differences in physicochemical properties between those inhibiting viral entry and viral replication.

To gain knowledge about the pathology that may contribute to disease progression and fatality, we performed post-mortem needle core biopsies of lung, liver, and heart in four patients who died of COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients&amp;rsquo; ages ranged from 59 to 81, including 3 males and 1 female. Each patient had at least one underlying disease, including immunocompromised status (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal transplantation) or other conditions (cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes). Time from disease onset to death ranged from 15 to 52 days. All patients had elevated white blood cell counts, with significant rise toward the end, and all had lymphocytopenia except for the patient with leukemia. Histologically, the main findings are in the lungs, including injury to the alveolar epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation, and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, all components of diffuse alveolar damage. Consolidation by fibroblastic proliferation with extracellular matrix and fibrin forming clusters in airspaces is evident. In one patient, the consolidation consists of abundant intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, consistent with superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. The liver exhibits mild lobular infiltration by small lymphocytes, and centrilobular sinusoidal dilation. Patchy necrosis is also seen. The heart shows only focal mild fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, changes likely related to the underlying conditions. In conclusion, the post-mortem examinations show advanced diffuse alveolar damage, as well as superimposed bacterial pneumonia in some patients. Changes in the liver and heart are likely secondary or related to the underlying diseases.</jats:p>"

The 3C-like protease (3CLpro), an essential enzyme for viral replication, is a valid target to compacts SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In this research, an integrated library consisting of 1000 compounds from Asinex Focused Covalent (AFCL) library and 16 FDA-approved protease inhibitors were screened against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Top compounds with significant docking scores and making stable interactions with catalytic dyad residues were obtained. The screening results in identification of compound 621 from AFCL library as well as Paritaprevir and Simeprevir from FDA-approved protease inhibitors as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The mechanism and dynamic stability of binding between the identified compounds and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were characterized using 50 nanoseconds (ns) molecular dynamic (MD) simulation approach. The identified compounds are potential inhibitors worthy of further development as SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors/drugs.

Many important aspects about 2019-nCoV remain largely unknown, among which, the limitation of antiviral therapies represents one of the most critical problems. More recently, it was confirmed that human ACE2 is the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV into lower respiratory tract epithelial cells. Give this observation, it is thus expected that the virus could be inhibited if we decrease the expression of ACE2. Here by screening two databases, Connectivity Map (CMap) and our JeaMoon Map (JMap), we identified a number of candidate agents that decrease ACE2 expression. CMap analysis identified 5 compounds, among which, Azathioprine is a possible therapeutic strategy for anti-2019-nCoV. Moreover, JMap analysis revealed a number of comounds, biologics, and traditional Chinese medicine, among which, Andrographis, Urtica, Sambucus, Astragalus, valproic acid, butyrate, and epoxomicin represent the most significant and possible strategies for anti-2019-nCoV therapies.

The present study aimed to assess bioactive compounds found in medicinal plants as potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors, using a molecular docking study. Molecular docking was performed using Autodock 4.2, with the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm, to analyse the probability of docking. COVID-19 Mpro was docked with several compounds, and docking was analysed by Autodock 4.2, Pymol version 1.7.4.5 Edu, and Biovia Discovery Studio 4.5. Nelfinavir and lopinavir were used as standards for comparison. The binding energies obtained from the docking of 6LU7 with native ligand, nelfinavir, lopinavir, kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin-7-glucoside, demethoxycurcumin, naringenin, apigenin-7-glucoside, oleuropein, curcumin, catechin, epicatechin-gallate, zingerol, gingerol, and allicin were -8.37, -10.72, -9.41, -8.58, -8.47, -8.17, -7.99, -7.89, -7.83, -7.31, -7.05, -7.24, -6.67, -5.40, -5.38, and -4.03 kcal/mol, respectively.

According to the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex (PDB ID: 6NUR) structure of SARS, two homologous models were established for virtual screening in the present study, namely NSP12-NSP7 interface model and NSP12-NSP8 interface model. Seven compounds (Saquinavir, Tipranavir, Lonafarnib, Tegobuvir, Olysio, Filibuvir, and Cepharanthine) were selected for binding free energy calculations based on virtual screening and docking scores.

ACE2 is an important part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and a key protein needed for COVID-19 to invade cells. First of all, we searched the HPA, GTEx and FANTOM5 Databases and found that the expression of ACE2 in kidney tissue was significantly higher than that in lung tissue. Then, by searching the Nephroseq Database, it is further verified that ACE2 is highly expressed in renal tissue and plays a protective role in renal tissue. However, current studies have found that the incidence of AKI caused by COVID-19 is much lower than that of ARDS. Because of this, we further searched the proteins interacting with ACE2 protein through the STING Database and analyzed the expression of tissue protein mRNA in the HPA Database. It was noted that AGTR2 mRNA was highly expressed in lung tissue, but low in kidney tissue, and hard tissue specificity in lung tissue. Through further research, it is found that AGTR2 plays a major role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, AGTR2 may be a key protein in COVID-19 pneumonia, and AGTR2 may be a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>"

The delivery of viral RNA into most cells hence triggers innate antiviral defenses that recognize viral RNA as foreign. In turn, viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert these defenses, allowing them to thrive in target cells. Therefore, drugs activating defense to foreign or exogenous RNA could serve as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Here we show that transcriptional signatures associated with cellular responses to the delivery of a non-viral exogenous RNA sequence into human cells predicts small molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In particular, transcriptional responses to the delivery of cas9 mRNA into human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) highly matches those triggered by small molecules with broad-spectrum antiviral activity such as emetine, homoharringtonine, pyrvinium pamoate and anisomycin, indicating that these drugs are potentially active against other RNA viruses. Furthermore, these drugs have been approved for other indications and could thereby be repurposed to novel viruses. We propose that the antiviral activity of these drugs to SARS-CoV-2 should therefore be determined as they have been shown as active against other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These drugs could also be explored as potential adjuvants to COVID-19 vaccines in development due to their potential effect on the innate antiviral defenses that could bolster adaptive immunity when delivered alongside vaccine antigens.</jats:p>"

Here, we analyzed how the scientific community responded to this challenge by quantifying distribution and availability patterns of the academic information related to COVID-19. The aim of our study was to assess the quality of the information flow and scientific collaboration, two factors we believe to be critical for finding new solutions for the ongoing pandemic. Materials and Methods: The RISmed R package, and a custom Python script were used to fetch metadata on articles indexed in PubMed and published on rXiv preprint server. Scopus was manually searched and the metadata was exported in BibTex file. Publication rate and publication status, affiliation and author count per article, and submission-to-publication time were analysed in R. Biblioshiny application was used to create a world collaboration map. Results: Our preliminary data suggest that COVID-19 pandemic resulted in generation of a large amount of scientific data, and demonstrates potential problems regarding the information velocity, availability, and scientific collaboration in the early stages of the pandemic. More specifically, our results indicate precarious overload of the standard publication systems, delayed adoption of the preprint publishing, significant problems with data availability and apparent deficient collaboration. Conclusion: In conclusion, we believe the scientific community could have used the data more efficiently in order to create proper foundations for finding new solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we believe we can learn from this on the go and adopt open science principles and a more mindful approach to COVID-19-related data to accelerate the discovery of more efficient solutions. We take this opportunity to invite our colleagues to contribute to this global scientific collaboration by publishing their findings with maximal transparency. </jats:p>"

This study aims to reveal the potential of compounds contained in Curcuma sp., Citrus sp., Alpinia galanga, and Caesalpinia sappan as anti SARS-CoV-2 through its binding to 3 protein receptors. The study was conducted by molecular docking using the MOE 2010 program (licensed from Faculty of Pharmacy UGM, Indonesia). The selected protein targets are RBD-S (PDB ID:6LXT), PD-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6VW1), and SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB ID:6LU7). The affinities of bonds formed is represented as a docking score. The results show that hesperidin, one of the compounds in Citrus sp., has the lowest docking score for all three protein receptors representing the highest affinity to bind the receptors. Moreover, all of the citrus flavonoids possess good affinity to the respected receptors as well as curcumin, brazilin, and galangin, indicating that those compounds perform inhibitory potential for the viral infection and replication.

Currently, more information is needed for further understanding the transmission, clinical characteristics, and infection control of 2019-nCOV. Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCOV has been intensively discussed. Previous investigations about other high infectious human COVs, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), may provide helpful information. In this review, we describe the genomics and morphology of human CoVs, the epidemiology, systemic and ophthalmic manifestations, mechanisms of human CoVs infection, and infection control procedures. The role of the eye in the transmission of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCOV is discussed. Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of ocular surface and upper respiratory tract is connected by nasolacrimal duct and share same receptors for some respiratory viruses. The eye is rarely involved by human CoVs infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV infection, and COV RNA positive rate in tears and conjunctival scrapings tested by RT-PCR from patients with SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV infection is also very low, which imply that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human COVs infection, nor is a preferred gateway of entry for human COVs to infect respiratory tract. However, considering close doctor-patient contact is quite common in ophthalmic practice which are apt to transmit human COVs by droplets and fomites, hand hygiene and personal protection are still highly recommended for health care workers to avoid hospital-related viral transmission during ophthalmic practice.</jats:p>"

Here we present a set of safety recommendations based on our review of literature and communications with physicians with first-hand knowledge of safety procedures during the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic.Observations: A high number of healthcare providers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in Wuhan province. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for healthcare providers without jeopardizing the care of patients. We reviewed the most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to healthcare workers. Specific recommendations were made, based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Preserving highly skilled healthcare work force is a top priority for any community and healthcare system. Based on the experience of healthcare systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of healthcare providers could be significantly reduced, while providing high levels of care. The provided recommendations could be used as broad guidance for all healthcare workers who are involved with the care of COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>"

The infection primarily involves the respiratory tract. Hitherto, some Covid-19 pneumonia patients carry the viral nucleic acids, and the active virus was detected in stool specimens. The virus discharged with feces is a potential contagious source. In the present study, three Covid-19 respiratory tract infection patients showed no gastrointestinal symptoms, and two were positive for viral nucleic acids in anal swab specimens remained positive 6 and at least 14 days after virus turned negative in the respiratory tract, respectively (details of the patients were listed in Fig 1).

Prion-like domains are critical for virulence and the development of therapeutic targets; however, the prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome have not been analyzed. In this in silico study, using the PLAAC algorithm, we identified the presence of prion-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared with other viruses, a striking difference was observed in the distribution of prion-like domains in the spike, since SARS-CoV-2 was the only coronavirus with a prion-like domain found in the receptor-binding domain of the S1 region of the spike protein. The presence and unique distribution of prion-like domains in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains of spike proteins is particularly interesting, since although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S share the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity for ACE2. Finally, we identified prion-like domains in the &amp;alpha;1 helix of the ACE2 receptor that interacts with the viral receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the identified PrDs in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and ACE2 region that interacts with RBD have important functional roles in viral adhesion and entry.</jats:p>"

SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence similarity and uses the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as does severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have provided bioinformatic evidence of potential routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection in respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive and urinary systems. However, whether the reproductive system is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been determined. Here, we investigate the expression pattern of ACE2 in adult human testis at the level of single-cell transcriptomes. The results indicate that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells. Gene ontology analyses indicate that GO categories associated with viral reproduction and transmission are highly enriched in ACE2-positive spermatogonia while male gamete generation related terms are down-regulated. Cell-cell junction and immunity related GO terms are increased in ACE2-positive Leydig and Sertoli cells, but mitochondria and reproduction related GO terms are decreased.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (HCoV-19) was identified in Wuhan, China. Because ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for HCoV-19, we hypothesize that CS affects the expression pattern of ACE2 in respiratory tract, causing differences in susceptibility to the virus. Methods: Three datasets (GSE994, GSE17913, and GSE18344), were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Correlation and enrichment analysis were used to evaluate the function of ACE2. Also, the different expression of ACE2 in different groups of three datasets were analyzed. Results: Genes associated with ACE2 were enriched in important biological processes such as viral processes and immune response. Elevated ACE2 were found in intrapulmonary airways (GSE994) and oral epithelial cells (GSE17913) of smokers but not those of non-smokers or former smokers. Significant dose- and time-dependent relationships between CS and ACE2 expression were observed in mouse lung tissues, and long periods without smoking were found to significantly reduce ACE2 expression. Conclusions: Both human and rat data confirmed that CS could induce increased ACE2 in the respiratory tract, indicating that smokers have a higher susceptibility to HCoV-19.</jats:p>"

Recent studies have reported that patients with hypertension and diabetes treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers might be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection as these drugs have been reported to increase ACE2 expression. This has raised the need to systematically investigate the effect of different drugs including antihypertensives on modulating ACE2 expression. Here, we analyzed a publicly available CMAP dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules. We show that only one subclass of antihypertensives drugs - ACE inhibitors, are significantly enriched for drugs up-regulating ACE2 expression. Studying the effects of the 672 clinically approved drugs in CMAP, we chart the drug categories that affect ACE2 expression. Specifically, we find that panobinostat (an HDAC inhibitor) confers the highest up-regulation of ACE2 expression while isotretinoin (a vitamin A derivative) is its strongest down-regulator.

In fact, this transmission characteristic is a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. Cases have now spread to at least 4 continents, currently with 43,108 cases and 1,018 lives lost. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. There is no current evidence from random clinical trials (RCTs) to recommend any specific anti-nCoV treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. In order to mitigate the impact of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, here we propose an innovative superinfection therapeutic (SIT) strategy, which could complement the development of prophylactic vaccines. SIT is based on clinical observations that unrelated viruses might interact in co-infected patients. During SIT, the patient benefit from superinfection with an apathogenic dsRNA virus such as the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), which is a powerful activator of the interferon-dependent antiviral gene program. An attenuated vaccine strain of IBDV was already successfully administered to resolve acute and persistent infections induced by two completely different viruses, the hepatitis B (DNA) and C (RNA) viruses (HBV/HCV). Importantly, IBDV is also a potential prophylactic vaccine vector drug candidate, since a recombinant IBDV was previously generated that displays exogenous viral peptides from a replication-competent IBDV.</jats:p>"

Here, the recently resolved 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) in complex with its receptor-the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) have provided the basis for screening chemical database for novel entry inhibitors. Methods: Molecular docking protocols have been used to rapidly screen FDA database for high affinity interaction at the SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE-2 interface. One of the top candidate ubrogepant has been using atomistic molecular dynamics simulation method. Results: Molecular docking result showed that ubrogepant (UBR) and darunavir have binding energies of -10.4 kcal/mol. MMPBSA free energy analyses of UBR bound to RBD, ACE-2 and RBD/ACE-2 revealed RBD/ACE-2 &amp;gt; ACE-2 &amp;gt; RBD preference. Network analysis showed that interaction captured in the crystal structure were disrupted in UBR-bound state, hydration of the interface and increased atomic fluctuation within the RBD oligomerization interface and ACE-2 zinc binding site. Conclusions: The ability of ubrogepant to rupture the interaction at the RBD/ACE-2 interface residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE-2 complex may result in loss of protein function with direct implication on oligomerization formation in RBD and loss of function in ACE-2 thus, making binding, cellular receptor recognition impossible.  General Significance: Ubrogepant represents a new therapeutic candidate in the fight against COVID-19, as it binds with relatively high affinity with free RBD, ACE-2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE-2 complex based on binding affinity calculations</jats:p>"

Since then, it has been transmitted rapidly in China and the rest of the world. While Covid-19 transmission rate has been declining in China, it is increasing exponentially in Europe and America. Although there are numerous studies examining Covid-19 infection, including an archived paper looking into the meteorological effect, the role of outdoor air pollution has yet to be explored rigorously. It has been shown that air pollution will weaken the immune system, and increase the rate of respiratory virus infection. We postulate that outdoor air pollution concentrations will have a negative effect on Covid-19 infections in China, whilst lockdowns, characterized by strong social distancing and home isolation measures, will help to moderate such negative effect. Methods: We will collect the number of daily confirmed Covid-19 cases in 31 provincial capital cities in China during the period of 1 Dec 2019 to 20 Mar 2020 (from a popular Chinese online platform which aggregates all cases reported by the Chinese national/provincial health authorities). We will also collect daily air pollution and meteorology data at the city-level (from the Chinese National Environmental Monitoring Center and the US National Climatic Data Center), daily inter-city migration flows and intra-city movements (from Baidu). City-level demographics including age distribution and gender, education, and median household income can be obtained from the statistical yearbooks. City-level co-morbidity indicators including rates of chronic disease and co-infection can be obtained from related research articles. A regression model is developed to model the relationship between the infection rate of Covid-19 (number of confirmed cases/population at the city level) and outdoor air pollution at the city level, after taking into account confounding factors such as meteorology, inter- and intra-city movements, demographics, and co-morbidity and co-infection rates. In particular, we shall study how air pollution affects infection rates across different cities, including Wuhan. Our model will also study air pollution would affect infection rates in Wuhan before and after the lockdown. Expected findings: We expect there be a correlation between Covid-19 infection rate and outdoor air pollution. We also expect that reduced intra-city movement after the lockdowns in Wuhan and the rest of China will play an important role in reducing the infection rate. Interpretation: Infection rate is growing exponentially in major cities worldwide. We expect Covid-19 infection rate is related to the air pollution concentration, and is strongly dependent on inter- and intra-city movements. To reduce the infection rate, the international community may deploy effective air pollution reduction plans and social distancing policies.</jats:p>"

With the first level response to public health emergencies (FLRPHE) launched over the country, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China is achieving under control in China. We develop a mathematical model based on epidemiology of COVID-19, incorporating the isolation of healthy people, confirmed cases and close contacts. We calculate the basic reproduction numbers 2.5 in China (excluding Hubei province) and 2.9 in Hubei province with the initial time on January 30 which show the severe infectivity of COVID-19, and verify that the current isolation method effectively contains the transmission of COVID-19. Under the isolation of healthy people, confirmed cases and close contacts, we find a noteworthy phenomenon that is the potential second epidemic of COVID-19, and estimate the peak time and value and the cumulative number of cases. Simulations show that the isolation of close contacts tracked measure can efficiently contain the transmission of the potential second epidemic of COVID-19. With isolation of all susceptible people or all infected people or both, there is no potential second epidemic of COVID-19. Furthermore, resumption of work and study can increase the transmission risk of the potential second epidemic of COVID-19.</jats:p>"

The renin-angiotensin (RAS) signaling pathway, oxidative stress and cell death, cytokines storm and endothelial dysfunction are four major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of nCoV 19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) generally develops with a massive oxidative/nitrosative stress following virus entry and RAS activation. The DNA damage subsequent to oxidative burst activates poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1), viral macrodomain (NSP3) poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and transient receptor potential channel, melastatin 2 (TRPM2) in a sequential manner ultimately leading to apoptosis and necrosis due to NAD and ATP depletion. Regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in nCoV 19 pathogenesis, angiotensin II receptor blockers and/or PARP, PARG and TRPM2 blockers could be engaged as therapeutic candidates for inhibition of RAS and quenching oxidative stress, respectively.

Thus, gaining more knowledge on the pathogenicity mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, the causing agent of COVID-19, and its interaction with the immune system is of utmost importance. Although this novel virus is not well known yet, its structural and genetic similarity with SARS-CoV as well as the comparable pattern of age-mortality relations suggest that the previous findings on SARS can be applicable for COVID-19. Therefore, a systems biology study was conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism for the differences in the age-specific mortality of SARS and the most important signaling pathways activated by the virus. The results were then validated through a literature review on COVID-19 and the other closely related viruses, SARS and MERS. Interferons have shown to possess a crucial role in the defense against coronavirus diseases. The virus can impede the interferon induction in humans. Moreover, STAT1, a key protein in the interferon mediated immune response, is antagonized by the virus. This could explain the increased response threshold of immune cells to IFNs during CoV infections. A vivid correlation between the innate immune response threshold and the fatality rates in COVID-19 can be found. Differences in the dynamics of the interferons-related innate immune responses in children, adults and elderly may explain the reported fatality rates. The increased mortality rates in the elderly can be explained by the higher threshold of interferon-mediated immune responses. Earlier induction of interferons in children and their less developed immune system could be the reason behind their zero or near to zero fatality rate. Administration of interferon-inducing agents, such as Poly (ICLC), could reduce the mortality of SARS at the very early stages of the disease. Adding interferon-&amp;gamma; to an interferon-I, as a synergistic combination therapy, might maximize the benefits.At the later stages of the disease, however, the balance of the immune reactions would be disrupted and the responses would shift toward immnopathogenic over-reactions and probably cytokine storm. Moderating the activity of the immune system and supportive care in such conditions might be the optimum approach.</jats:p>"

Here, we identify compounds that transcriptionally inhibit host proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 entry and should be evaluated for efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection assays. Recognizing the need for immediately available treatment options, we focused particular attention on FDA-approved drugs that could be immediately repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients. By mining publicly available gene expression data, we identify several compounds that down-regulate TMPRSS2, a protein required for SARS-CoV-2 entry that has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Among these, we find twenty independent studies that implicate estrogen-related and androgen-related compounds as transcriptional modulators of TMPRSS2 expression, suggesting that these drugs and others acting on the pathway may be promising therapeutic candidates for COVID-19 for further testing. It is also noteworthy that TMPRSS2 has highly variable and skewed expression in humans, spanning two orders of magnitude with a small minority of individuals having extremely high expression. Combined with literature showing that TMPRSS2 loss-of-function in mouse is protective against SARS while anti-estrogen treatment predicted to increase TMPRSS2 expression exacerbates SARS, this observation raises the hypothesis that TMPRSS2 expression may positively correlate with severity in COVID-19.</jats:p>"

The CoV and CoV2 Mpro are 97% identical at the sequence level, with 12 variable residues, and their X-ray structures appear similar. We thus structurally analysed how these variable residues affect the intra-molecular interactions between key residues in the CoV2 Mpro active-site. Compared to CoV Mpro, the 12 divergent residues in CoV2 Mpro exhibit modified intra-molecular interaction networks that ultimately restructure the molecular micro-environment. These altered networks also indirectly affect the networks of other active-site residues at the entrance (T26, M49 and Q192) and near the catalytic region (F140, H163, H164, M165 and H172) of the Mpro. This suggest CoV2 indirectly (via neighbours) reshape key molecular networks around the Mpro active-site. It seems that the CoV2 Mpro deceives us with its apparent structurally identical to the CoV Mpro while this viral system accumulates mass mutations (12 variable residues) at key positions.

The model was used to carry out in silico screening to identify molecules among natural products, or FDA approved drugs that can potentially inhibit the activity of nsp12. This exercise showed that vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) may bind to the active site of the nsp12 protein. A model of the nsp12 in complex with substrate RNA and incoming NTP showed that Vitamin B12 binding site overlaps with that of the incoming nucleotide. A comparison of the calculated energies of binding for RNA plus NTP and methylcobalamin suggested that the vitamin may bind to the active site of nsp12 with significant affinity. It is, therefore, possible that methylcobalamin binding may prevent association with RNA and NTP and thus inhibit the RdRP activity of nsp12. Overall, our computational studies suggest that methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 may serve as an effective inhibitor of the nsp12 protein. </jats:p>"

During winter, people who do not take vitamin D supplements are likely to have low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. Vitamin D can reduce the risk of viral epidemics and pandemics in several ways. First, higher 25(OH)D concentrations reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory tract infections (RTIs), diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Patients with chronic diseases have significantly higher risk of death from RTIs than otherwise healthy people. Second, vitamin D reduces risk of RTIs through three mechanisms: maintaining tight junctions, killing enveloped viruses through induction of cathelicidin and defensins, and reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines by the innate immune system, thereby reducing the risk of a cytokine storm leading to pneumonia. Observational and supplementation trials have reported higher 25(OH)D concentrations associated with reduced risk of dengue, hepatitis, herpesvirus, hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infections, and pneumonia. Results of a community field trial reported herein indicated that 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/l) vs. &amp;lt;20 ng/ml were associated with a 27% reduction in influenza-like illnesses. From the available evidence, we hypothesize that raising serum 25(OH)D concentrations through vitamin D supplementation could reduce the incidence, severity, and risk of death from influenza, pneumonia, and the current COVID-19 epidemic.</jats:p>"
Preprints.org,10.20944/preprints202003.0345.v1,NA,2020-03-23,Widely Available Lysosomotropic Agents Should Be Considered as a Potential Therapy for COVID-19,"<jats:p>While the COVID-19 pandemic advances, the scientific community struggles in the search for treatments. Several improvements have been made, including the discovery of clinical efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) in COVID-19 patients, but the effective treatment protocols are still missing. In order to find novel treatment options many scientists utilize the in silico approach to identify compounds that could interfere with the key molecules involved in entrance, replication, or dissemination of the SARS-CoV-2. However, most of the identified molecules are currently not available as pharmacological agents, and assessing their safety and efficacy could take many months. Here, we took a different approach based on the proposed pharmacodynamic model of CQ in COVID-19. The main mechanism of action responsible for the favourable outcome of COVID-19 patients treated with CQ seems to be related to pH modulation-mediated effect on the endolysosomal trafficking, a characteristic of chemical compounds often called lysosomotropic agents because of the physico-chemical properties that enable them to passively diffuse through the endosomal membrane and undergo protonation-based trapping in the lumen of the acidic vesicles. In this review, we discuss lysosomotropic drugs that are already in clinical use and are characterized by good safety profiles, low cost, and wide availability. We emphasize that some of these drugs, in particular azithromycin and other macrolide antibiotics, indomethacin and some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and fluoxetine could provide additional therapeutic benefits in addition to the potential antiviral effect that still has to be confirmed by well-controlled clinical trials. As some of these drugs, mostly antibiotics, were already empirically used in the treatment of COVID-19, we encourage our colleagues all over the world to publish patient data so potential efficacy of lysosomotropic agents can be evaluated in the clinical context and rapidly implemented in the therapeutic protocols if the beneficial effect on clinical outcome is observed.</jats:p>"

We proof the CONCENTRATION in a small r&amp;eacute;gion of wuhan New genome of 3 different r&amp;eacute;gions from HIV1 ENVELOPPE GENE. In this article, we demonstrate that there is a kind of global human hosts adaptation strategy of SARS viruses as well as a strategy of global evolution of the genomes of the different strains of SARS which have emerged, mainly in China, between years 2003 first SARS genomes and the last 2020 nCoV-2019 Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome. This global strategy, this temporal link, is materialized in our demonstration by highlighting stationary numerical waves controlling the entire sequence of their genomes. Curiously, these digital waves characterizing the 9 SARS genomes studied here are characteristic whole numbers: the ""Fibonacci numbers"", omnipresent in the forms of Nature, and which our research for several decades has shown strong links with the proportions of nucleotides in DNA. Here we demonstrate that the complexity and fractal multiplicity of these Fibonacci numerical waves increases over the years of the emergence of new sArs strains. We suggest that this increase in the overall organization of the SARS genomes over the years reflects a better adaptation of SARS genomes to the human host. The question of a link with pathogenicity remains open. However, we believe that this overall strategy for the evolution of the SARS genomes ensures greater unity, consistency and integrity of the genome. Finally, we ask ourselves the question of a possible artificial origin of this genome, in particular because of the presence of fragments of HIV1 retrovirus.

In this article, we argue against a blanket interpretation that being labeled “essential personnel” means that all in person ABA services for all clients should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this argument holds even if ABA providers are not in a jurisdiction currently under an active shelter at home or related order. First, we provide a brief description of risks associated with continued in person ABA service delivery as well as risks associated with the temporary suspension or transition to remote ABA service delivery. For many clients, continued in person service delivery carries a significant risk of severe harm to the client, their family and caregivers, the staff, and a currently overburdened healthcare system. In these situations, ABA providers should temporarily suspend services or transition to telehealth or other forms of remote service delivery until information from federal, state, and local healthcare experts deem in person contact safe. In rare cases, temporary suspension or transition to remote service delivery may place the client or others at risk of significant harm. In these situations in person services should likely continue and ongoing assessment and risk mitigation are essential.</p>"

Do differently phrased public-health messages appeal to different people? I based predictions on the five-factor, triarchic psychopathy, and Dark Triad models of normal-range and dark traits; the extended parallel process model (EPPM); and schema-congruence theory. In a survey of 502 online participants, normal-range traits (esp. agreeableness and conscientiousness) predicted endorsement of social distancing and hygiene, as well as the appeal of health messages in general. Consistent with the EPPM, conscientiousness and neuroticism evidenced an interaction. Dark traits (esp. psychopathy, meanness, and disinhibition) predicted low endorsement of health behaviors and the intent to knowingly expose others to risk. Most participants preferred a message appealing to compassion (“Help protect the vulnerable...”), but dark traits predicted lower appeal of that message. Personality appears relevant to epidemiology and public-health communication in a contagious-disease context.</p>"

Unfortunately, many Americans dismissed the pandemic as a hoax and failed to properly engage in helpful behaviors like social-distancing and increased hand-washing. Here, we examine a disposition—willingness to engage in analytic-thinking—that might predict beliefs that the pandemic is a hoax and failures to change behavior in positive ways. Our results indicate that individuals less willing to engage effortful, deliberative, and reflective cognitive processes were more likely to believe the pandemic was a hoax, and less likely to have recently engaged in social-distancing and hand-washing.

Government efforts to minimize the spread of disease emphasized behavioral interventions, including raising awareness of the disease and encouraging protective behaviors such as social distancing and hand washing, and seeking medical attention if experiencing symptoms. However, it is unclear to what extent individuals are aware of the risks associated with the disease, how they are altering their behavior, factors which could influence the spread of the virus to vulnerable populations. We characterized risk perception and engagement in preventative measures in 1591 United States based individuals over the first week of the pandemic (March 11th-16th 2020) and examined the extent to which protective behaviors are predicted by individuals’ perception of risk. Over 5 days, subjects demonstrated growing awareness of the risk posed by the virus, and largely reported engaging in protective behaviors with increasing frequency. However, they underestimated their personal risk of infection relative to the average person in the country. We found that engagement in social distancing and handwashing was most strongly predicted by the perceived likelihood of personally being infected, rather than likelihood of transmission or severity of potential transmitted infections. However, substantial variability emerged among individuals, and using data-driven methods we found a subgroup of subjects who are largely disengaged, unaware, and not practicing protective behaviors. Our results have implications for our understanding of how risk perception and protective behaviors can facilitate early interventions during large-scale pandemics.</p>"

Intellectual input from various aspects is needed to control the COVID-19, including the understanding of the public’s emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study examined three cognitive appraisals (i.e., knowledge, perceived severity and perceived controllability of the COVID-19) and their associations with a wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes among the Chinese public. Participants were 4607 citizens (age range: 17–90 years, Mage=23.71 years) from 31 provinces in China and they took part in an online survey. The results showed that the public’s emotional and behavioural reactions were slightly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19. Moreover, the public had limited participation in the events regarding the COVID-19 but actively engaged in precautionary behaviour. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the three appraisals were differentially related to the outcome variables. Theoretically, the findings highlight the utility of cognitive appraisal, as a core process of coping stress, in explaining the public’s emotion and behaviour in the encounter of public health concern. Practically, the findings facilitate the government and practitioners to design and deliver targeted intervention programs to the public affected by the COVID-19.</p>"

This research assessed key attitudes of the Spanish people toward COVID-19. One study (n =64) was conducted in a shopping center in Madrid and another (n= 640) online. The results of both studies suggest that women in Spain have a ‘more responsible’ attitude toward the COVID-19 than men. Young adults (18-25 years) appear to perceive less threatening the epidemic than older adults. Spanish people’s personal concern about COVID-19 is less than their perceived social alarm about it. Compliance is the strongest  predictor of the approval to stay at home, which is the highest rated preventive measure by the Spanish people. These results might help policy makers in targeting public attitudes which could play an important role in the exponentially rising cases of COVID-19.</p>"

To this aim, we administered an online questionnaire about COVID-19 together with other questionnaires assessing the psychological condition of participants. First, we found that the exposition to infection risk, due to living area or job, increased the perceived stress and anxiety (i.e. medical staff in North Italy was more stressed and anxious respect to both medical- and non-medical participants from Center and South Italy). Then, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression models on our data to assess the response odds ratio relatively to each predictor on each dependent variable. We found that health workers reported higher risk perception, level of worry, and knowledge as related to COVID-19 infection compared to general population. Also psychological state, gender, and living area were important predictors of these factors. Instead, judgments about behaviors and containment rules were more linked to demographics, such as gender and alcohol consumption.

Comparing self-interested versus prosocially framed COVID-19 prevention messaging,"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic threatens millions of lives, and an effective response will require individuals to take costly and difficult measures to slow the rate of transmission. Yet it is unclear how to best motivate preventative actions, which can be conceptualized as either self-interested or cooperative efforts. Should public health messaging focus on the benefits of prevention to individuals, society, or both? We shed light on this question across two pre-registered studies conducted online via Amazon Mechanical Turk (total n = 2176 Americans) during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic reaching the United States. We investigated the effects of three treatments, consisting of a written appeal and a flier, on intentions to engage in coronavirus prevention behaviors. We presented identical information across treatments, but varied our framing to emphasize the personal, public, or both personal and public benefits of prevention behaviors. While all three treatments increased prevention intentions relative to a no-information control, we found important differences across treatments. In particular, we found strong evidence for the power of prosocial framing: the Public treatment was more effective than the Personal treatment, and the Personal+Public treatment was no more effective than the pure Public treatment. Our results thus suggest that emphasizing the public benefits of prevention efforts may be an effective pandemic response strategy.</p>"

However, the relationship between emotions, empathy, and prosocial behaviour is unknown. It is said that empathy is affected by moods and influences pro-sociality. Thus, how does an emergency change people’s empathy and prosocial willingness? We conducted a study with 1,190 participants before (N=520) and after (N=570) the coronavirus outbreak. We found that prosocial willingness decreased post-outbreak, maybe by the decreased empathy levels, in accordance with compassion fatigue theory. Trait empathy could affect prosocial willingness indirectly through the empathy level. News discriminability and distance from the outbreak epicentre played a role in the trait empathy change. Given how emergency health events influence emotion and the effects of personal traits on prosocial willingness, social media users and providers should understand the negative effects of information over-exposure on mental health during the outbreak.</p>"

However, when threat is uncertain and continuous, as in the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, fear can become chronic and burdensome. To better understand predictors of fear of the coronavirus, we conducted an online survey (N = 439) between March 14 and 17, 2020, which started three days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Fear of the coronavirus was assessed with eight questions pertaining to different dimensions of fear (e.g., subjective worry, avoidance, preferential attention) and an open-ended question. The predictors included measures of psychological vulnerability factors (i.e., intolerance of uncertainty, worry, health anxiety), media exposure, and personal relevance (i.e., personal health, risk for loved ones, and risk control). We found that respondents reported a wide range of concerns relating to the coronavirus outbreak, such as their employment, spreading of the virus, and economic and societal consequences.

A salient recent example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has bred a multitude of falsehoods even as truth has increasingly become a matter of life-and-death. Here we investigate why people believe and spread false (and true) news content about COVID-19, and test an intervention intended to increase the truthfulness of the content people share on social media. Across two studies with over 1,600 participants (quota-matched to the American public on age, gender, ethnicity and geographic region), we find support for the idea that people share false claims about COVID-19 in part because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, participants who engaged in more analytic thinking and had greater science knowledge were more discerning in their belief and sharing. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study – i.e., asking people to judge the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline – more than doubled the level of truth discernment in participants’ sharing intentions. In the control, participants were equally like to say they would share false versus true headlines at COVID-19 whereas, in the treatment, sharing of true headlines was significantly higher than false headlines. Our results – which mirror those found previously for political fake news – suggest that nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media. Accuracy nudges are straightforward for social media platforms to implement on top of the other approaches they are currently employing, and could have an immediate positive impact on stemming the tide of misinformation about the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>"

This period was fraught with uncertainty for those in the affected areas. The present investigation examined the role of two potential coping resources during this stressful period of uncertainty: flow and mindfulness. Participants in Wuhan and other major cities affected by COVID-19 (N = 5115) completed an online survey assessing experiences of flow, mindfulness, and well-being. Longer quarantine was associated with poorer well-being; flow and mindfulness predicted better well-being on some measures. However, flow—but not mindfulness—moderated the link between quarantine length and well-being, such that people who experienced high levels flow showed little or no association between quarantine length and poorer well-being. These findings suggest that engaging in flow-inducing activities may be a particularly effective way to protect against the deleterious effects of a period of quarantine.</p>"

As expected, participants in the threat (vs. control) condition reported greater anxious arousal which, in turn, predicted greater blatant prejudice. Threat (vs. control) condition also indirectly predicted greater prejudice via greater anxious arousal. Results suggest that COVID-19 existential threat may diminish social capital, which would further degrade people’s health and well-being.</p>"

Moreover, parents and children know they need help managing these circumstances. Perhaps for the first time, behavior analysts hold the reinforcers for increasing parental involvement in effective child-rearing practices. In fact, behavior analysts can help parents enlist their children in managing the household by framing their behavior in terms of hidden superpowers. In the current paper, we argue that behavior analysts have a range of tools to offer which are grounded in evidence-based principles, strategies, and kernels, or essential units of behavioral influence. When combined into scheduled daily practices and invoked by children taught to see their use of the tools as nothing short of heroic, these practices function as vaccinations that inoculate families against toxic and unsafe behaviors.</p>"

An increasing amount of social scientific research has looked at the role of public message framing, for instance, but few studies have thus far examined the role of individual differences in emotional and personality-based variables in predicting virus-mitigating behaviors. In this study we recruited a large international community sample (N = 324) to complete measures of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of the virus, moral foundations, political orientation, and behavior change in response to the pandemic. Consistently, the only predictor of positive behavior change (e.g., social distancing, improved hand hygiene) was fear of COVID-19, with no effect of politically-relevant variables. We discuss these data in relation to the potentially functional nature of fear in global health crises.</p>"

Corresponding interventions often address cooperative behavior, because they pose restrictions on the individual level (e.g., limiting one’s physical contacts) with the aim to serve the greater good (e.g., not overtaxing the health systems). In a sample of Danish adults (N = 799) randomly drawn from a representative sample, we link different personality characteristics to people’s willingness in accepting personal restrictions for fighting COVID-19. When simultaneously considering all characteristics including the basic traits from the HEXACO personality model, we find that, next to people’s age, Emotionality as well as the Dark Factor of Personality (D) explain who is more willing to accept restrictions. D further explains acceptance based on whether restrictions aim to protect oneself rather than others. The results show the importance of individual differences for following large-scale interventions that should serve the greater good.</p>"

Based on a sample of 1,182 American adult residents (stratified for age and gender; data collection March 13 to 15, 2020), we found three distinct clusters of psychological responses (i.e., informed, panic, and ignorant). Clusters differed regarding their knowledge about the virus, SARS-CoV-2-related anxiety (i.e., worry and emotionality), and evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis’s severity. Cluster membership was strongly associated with both SARS-CoV-2 risk-reducing, reasonable behavior and unreasonable behavior. Finally, clusters could be linked to systematic differences in broader personality dimensions (i.e., Dark Triad and Big Five). Our study provides and validates a set of clusters of individual psychological responses to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the resulting behavior. It functions as a pivotal starting point for longitudinal observations on the effectiveness of public health communications in this global challenge.</p>"

Building on this notion, we predicted that the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus can affect attitudes toward foreign nationalities. We explored the inter-group consequences of the current epidemiological situation in two studies involving a total of 652 participants. In correlational Study 1, we showed a positive relationship between media exposure in the UK and in Poland and prejudice to four foreign nationalities. The Study 2 showed that negative affect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about Coronavirus through the increase in anxiety. Overall, our studies revealed that prejudice is sensitive to current epidemiological situation and our findings suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 may translate into severe social consequences and increased psychological distancing to nations most affected by the pandemic.</p>"

Although public health initiatives (i.e., social distancing) help manage its impact, these initiatives can further sever our connections to people and institutions that affirm our identities. Three studies (N=1,195) validated a brief 10-item COVID-19 threat scale that assesses 1) realistic threats to physical or financial safety, and 2) symbolic threats to one’s sociocultural identity. Studies reveal that both realistic and symbolic threat predict higher anxiety and lower wellbeing, and demonstrate convergent validity with other measures of threat sensitivity. Importantly, the two kinds of threat diverge in their relationship to public health behaviors (e.g., social distancing): Realistic threat predicted greater self-reported compliance, whereas symbolic threat predicted less self-reported compliance to these social-disconnection initiatives. Symbolic threat also predicted using creative ways to affirm identity even in isolation. Our findings highlight how social psychological theory can be leveraged to understand and predict people’s behavior in pandemics.</p>"

These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals. In recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases.Materials and methods: We searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population.Results: Among 1364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria. Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings. These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation. Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes.Conclusion: This umbrella review found severe mental health problems among individuals and populations who have undergone quarantine and isolation in different contexts. This evidence necessitates multipronged interventions including policy measures for strengthening mental health services globally and promoting psychosocial wellbeing among high-risk populations.</p>"

Mindfulness reduced daily anxiety. In addition, the sleep duration of participants in the mindfulness condition was less impacted by the increase of infections in the community compared with participants in the control condition. As the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and the number of cases reported in the community increase, our findings offer an evidence-based practice that may help people cope with news about an outbreak in the community.</p>"

We tested communication strategies to promote social distancing via an online experiment (N = 500) commissioned by Ireland’s Department of Health. A control group saw a current informational poster. Two treatment groups saw similar posters with messages that highlighted: (i) the risk of transmission to identifiable persons vulnerable to COVID-19; (ii) the exponential nature of transmission. We then measured judgements of behaviours previously identified by focus groups as “marginal” (meaning that people were not sure whether they were advisable, such meeting others outdoors, or visiting parents). We recorded intention to undertake behaviours and stated acceptability of behaviours. Our hypotheses, that both treatments would increase participants’ caution about marginal behaviours, were preregistered (i.e. lodged with an international organisation for open science before data collection). Results confirmed the hypotheses. The findings suggest that the thought of infecting vulnerable people or large numbers of people can motivate social distancing. This has implications for communications strategies. The study also demonstrates an effective way to identify outcome variables for rapid behavioural research on the COVID-19 response.</p>"

On 16.03.2020, we tested individuals’ beliefs about infection probabilities and abilities to practice social distancing in UK, USA and Germany. Given the rapidly evolving situation, we report here initial analyses in a preliminary brief manuscript. We found that individuals show an optimism bias: they estimate the probability of getting infected with the virus, and of infecting others if infected themselves as lower for themselves than for someone similar to them. We link this optimism to the estimated frequency of direct social contacts as well as to the necessity and ease of reducing these. Our ongoing studies will assess how these biases change over the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and how adaptive it is.</p>"

To reduce the spread of the virus, governments have restricted social life habits ranging from physical distancing to enforcing isolation at home. At present, we do not know whether the physical health-related benefits of these countermeasures outweigh potential mental health problems resulting from those restrictions. Here, we assessed in an online survey as how effective a range of countermeasures were perceived, how severely they affected daily life, about own behavior to protect oneself, perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and knowledge about the virus in an early phase of the outbreak in Norway, Germany, Israel, Colombia and Brazil. We also measured general distress, psychotic experiences and feeling of control.Among the over 2000 respondents the majority rated the countermeasures as effective in reducing the outbreak. School closings, not quarantine was perceived as largest daily life changer. People generally also rated their own actions as being effective, and nearly all engaged in handwashing and 9 out of 10 in social distancing. Perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 was lower than worry and fear about the virus. Feeling of control was a predictor of efficacy of countermeasures. Notably, those that stated that their country did not enough (many from Brazil and Colombia) perceived the risk of contracting the virus to be higher, were more worried and feared and perceived governmental actions as less efficient but their own actions as efficient in limiting the outbreak. We also found increased distress levels in those countries with more stringent lockdowns and higher proportion of not being satisfied with governmental actions.</p>"

As such, humans engage in behavioral avoidance to prevent contact with potential carriers of pathogens, such as reduced sociability at the interpersonal level and endorsement of strict immigration policies at the intergroup level. This research examines chronic concerns about infectious diseases (using the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease questionnaire) and travel ban supports in response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak in January 2020. Two studies were conducted in the United States (Study 1; N = 241) and Singapore (Study 2; N = 138). For Americans who scored higher on the Perceived Infectability subscale, they were more likely to endorse travel bans on people coming from China and all of Asia. For Singaporeans who reported greater Germ Aversion, they were more supportive of travel bans on people from both China and their Malaysian neighbor. Saliency of the outbreak may account for differences in subscale predictors between Americans and Singaporeans.</p>"

In late 2019, a novel coronavirus known as NCov-2019 emerged in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to most countries in the world. Anticipatory responses by civilians facing the crisis have included self-isolation measures, extreme stockpiling of food or medical supplies, and other forms of preparation to meet the expected crisis. However, no consensus exists as to the accuracy of civilian expectations, nor toward the relative value of different informational sources used by citizens to build these expectations (e.g. mainstream news as opposed to an educational background in virology). In the present study, we used an online survey (n = 333 in final sample) to collect individual characteristics and general knowledge regarding viruses and the novel coronavirus, in addition to their forecasts for the various outcomes expected to result from it in the near future. This will allow for the individual correlates of accurate forecasting to be known by 2021, which could prove important for assigning relative weights to forecasts for other events in the future.</p>"

This may be especially important to study among youth, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus.Objective: To examine psychological correlates of adolescents’ behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Self-report survey conducted between March 20th and March 22nd, 2020. Setting: This is an online survey study of youth from the United States.Participants: A population-based sample of adolescents were recruited via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Youth were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were between the ages of 13 and 18. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors over the 7 days after the US declared a national emergency. The correlates measured were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, values related to social responsibility, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, along with greater social responsibility and social trust, would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding.Results: The final analytic sample included 770 adolescents (Mage = 16.34, 72% female). The majority of teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (70%), but were monitoring the news (75%) and engaging in at least one disinfecting behavior multiple times per day (88%). Some teens reported engaging in hoarding behavior (19%). Greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing, disinfecting, and news monitoring, but also more hoarding. Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting and news monitoring, and less hoarding. Participants who reported valuing their own self-interest over others reported less social distancing and more hoarding. Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding.Conclusions and Relevance: Emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following recommended preventative health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.</p>"

In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Drawing on existing literature and our own experience of adapting treatments to the crisis we suggest a number of salient points to consider in identifying risks and offering support to all three groups. We also offer a number of practical and technical considerations for working psychotherapeutically with existing patients where COVID-19 restrictions have forced a move to online or technologically mediated delivery of psychological interventions.</p>"

Prior research suggests that individuals’ perceived severity of the COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioural reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this possibility. Participants were 4,607 citizens from 31 regions in China (Mage=23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for demographic variables, perceived severity of the COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the “perceived severity of the COVID-19 – mental health problems” association, with the said link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>"

Using insights from personality and social cognition approaches to health processes, modeling of past 7-day overall guideline adherence showed greater conscientiousness was directly associated with adherence, as well as indirectly associated with adherence through greater self-efficacy for following the guidelines. Greater perceptions of social endorsement of the guidelines, positive attitudes related to the guidelines, and stronger intentions to follow the guidelines were associated with greater adherence. Age, sex, education, income, children in the household, shelter-in-place orders, and self-rated health showed null to negligible associations with adherence.

However, as the construction of social stigma relates closely to group identities, creating xenophobia through stigmatizing out-group members may increase in-group solidarity, which can be taken as a political strategy for the government to avoid the blame from citizens. In this study, we experimentally examine: (1) whether labeling COVID-19 as ""Chinese Virus"" will result in increased stigmatization and xenophobia against Chinese immigrants; (2) whether the ""Chinese Virus"" label will reduce people's perceived blameworthiness of the federal government. Our results (N = 1,200) show that about 16% of participants located in the U.S. indicated xenophobia against Chinese immigrants, and perceived blameworthiness of the federal government was polarized as expected. Further, although stigmatization was not significantly triggered by the ""Chinese Virus"" label in the full sample, we do find statistically significant treatment effects in multiple political and demographic subgroups (21.47% increase in Democrats, 16.73% in Liberals, and 19.93% in whites, no effect in conservatives and Republicans while the stigmatization remains at higher levels than other groups). Meanwhile, our list experiment strategy detected no social desirability bias when measuring xenophobia, suggesting that stigmatizing Chinese immigrants was not suppressed by current social norms.

Here, we investigated the persuasiveness of messages inspired by three major moral traditions. A sample of US participants representative for age, sex and race/ethnicity (N=1032) viewed messages from either a leader or citizen containing deontological, virtue-based, utilitarian, or non-moral justifications for adopting social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured the messages’ effects on participants’ self-reported intentions to wash hands, avoid social gatherings, self-isolate, and share health messages, as well as their beliefs about others’ intentions, impressions of the messenger’s morality and trustworthiness, and beliefs about personal control and responsibility for preventing the spread of disease. Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, compared to non-moral control messages, deontological arguments had a modest effect on intentions to share the message. Message source (leader vs. citizen) did not moderate any of the observed effects of message type. A majority of participants predicted the utilitarian message would be most effective, but we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions or beliefs. We caution that our findings require confirmation in replication studies and are modest in size, likely due to ceiling effects on our measures of behavioral intentions and strong heterogeneity across all dependent measures along several demographic dimensions including age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, political conservatism, and religiosity. Although we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions and beliefs, exploratory analyses showed that individual differences in one key dimension of utilitarianism—impartial concern for the greater good—were strongly and positively associated with public health intentions and beliefs. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that public health messaging focused on duties and responsibilities toward family, friends and fellow citizens is a promising approach for future studies of interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the US. Ongoing work is investigating the reproducibility and generalizability of our findings across different populations, what aspects of deontological messages may drive their persuasive effects, and how such messages can be most effectively delivered across global populations.</p>"

To curb the spread of the disease, one measure implemented in many countries is minimizing close contact between people (“physical distancing”). Engaging in physical distancing is a prosocial act in the sense that it helps protecting other individuals, especially those most vulnerable to the virus. Building on this notion, we tested the idea that physical distancing can be the result of a genuine prosocial motivation—empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus. In three pre-registered studies that include samples from the US, the UK, and Germany (total N = 2,192) collected at the beginning of the outbreak, we show that (i) empathy is indeed a basic motivation for physical distancing, and (ii) inducing empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus promotes the motivation to adhere to physical distancing. In sum, the present research provides a better understanding of the basic motivation underlying the willingness to follow one important measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. We further point to the potential for policymakers to use empathy to promote physical distancing – in this way to increase the chance of saving lives.</p>"

Anxiety, lack of control, and conspiracy beliefs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic","<p>Threatening events (hurricanes, disease outbreaks, famines) are associated with an upsurge of conspiracy beliefs that provide people with simple explanations to tackle the feelings of anxiety and lack of control. In our study (N = 783), conducted shortly after the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in our country, we examined whether people with higher anxiety and lack of control concerning the pandemic adopt more conspiracy beliefs about the origin, spread and potential cure of the new coronavirus. We also tested whether the rise of coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs is associated with the endorsement of generic epistemically suspect (i.e. paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific) beliefs as well. Our results show that higher perception of risk and lower trust in institutions concerning the COVID-19 pandemic were related to the feelings of anxiety and lack of control which in turn predicted an increase in coronavirus-specific conspiracy beliefs. Importantly, these beliefs were further related to the higher endorsement of generic paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific beliefs. The results show how threatening events, such as the current pandemic, lead to a rise in various epistemically suspect beliefs by increasing people’s feelings of anxiety and lack of control.</p>"

PsyArXiv (OSF),10.31234/osf.io/ch72a,NA,2020-03-23,Will consumption rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic? A structural equation modeling research based on the psychological arousal theory,"<p>At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in Wuhan, which quickly became a major public health emergency with the fastest spread, the broadest range of infection, and the most difficult to control in the history of modern China. During the outbreak, 1.4 billion Chinese people suspended almost all social activities and stay at home. Although the prevention of the pandemic seems effective, China's consumer economy suffered a heavy blow in the first quarter of 2020. With the COVID-19 outbreak gradually controlled in China, many retail businesses are pinning their hopes on the rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic. This study discusses the psychological mechanism of the consumption rebound and the possible duration of this rebound with the theory of psychological arousal. Based on the results of structural equation modeling of 1464 Chinese people, this study found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, the perceived severity of the pandemic caused an insufficient level of psychological arousal and lead to a higher tendency of sensation seeking, and this will increase people's willingness to spend after the end of the pandemic. The results revealed that it might lead to a rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic, but this rebound is concentrated and short-lived. This study suggests that retail businesses need to realize that the rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic is not due to a sudden increase in social spending power, but because consumers urgently need to restore the normal level of psychological arousal through the sensory stimulation brought by consumption. Therefore, retail businesses should not only pay attention to deal with the rapid rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic, but also prepare plans for the normalization of consumption after the rebound weakens.</p>"

        <p>
            The 2019 novel respiratory virus (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 with rapid global socioeconomic disruptions and disease burden to healthcare. The current COVID-19 and previous emerging virus outbreaks highlight the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we showed that a defensin-like peptide P9R exhibited potent antiviral activity against pH-dependent viruses that require endosomal acidification for virus-host membrane fusion, including the enveloped coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), the pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, and the non-enveloped rhinovirus. P9R could significantly protect mice from lethal challenge by A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and showed low possibility to cause drug-resistance virus. Mechanistic studies indicated that the antiviral activity of P9R depended on the direct binding to viruses and the inhibition of virus-host endosomal acidification, which provides a new concept that virus-binding alkaline peptides could broadly inhibit pH-dependent viruses. These results suggest that the dual-functional virus- and host-targeting P9R could be a promising candidate for combating pH-dependent respiratory viruses.Authors Hanjun Zhao, Kelvin K. W.

        <p>
            Background: In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan and has since rapidly spread throughout China. The mortality rates of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in severe and critical cases are very high. In this public-health emergency, a high-efficiency administrative emergency-response mode in designated hospitals is needed. Method: As an affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, ours, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, is the only one designated for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Zhuhai, a mid-sized city. The NCP department, for which the president of the hospital is also the direct administrative lead, was established at an early stage of the epidemic at our hospital. This department includes core members of the pulmonary and critical-care medicine (PCCM) specialist and multidisciplinary team. Rather than adhering to national guidelines on NCP, we have focused on individualized treatment, timely adjustment thereof and management strategies in working with COVID-19 patients based on the professional opinions of a professor of respiratory medicine and an expert group. Results: (1) High working efficiency: As of March 2, 2020, we have completed 2974 citywide consultations and treatment of 366 inpatients, including 101 who were diagnosed with COVID-19. (2) Excellent therapeutic effect: Of the 101 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19, only 1 has died, and the rest were all cured and discharged. No secondary hospital infection, pipeline infection or pressure sores were found in any patient. (3) Finding and confirming person-to-person transmission characteristic of COVID-19 prior to the official press conference: Strengthened protection is key to zero infection among the healthcare providers and medical faculty, as well as to a lower rate of second-generation infectious patients. (4) Timely adjustment of management and treatment strategy prior to guideline updates: The first evidence of digestive-tract involvement in COVID-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of the disease was carried out at our hospital. Conclusions: At our hospital, establishment of an NCP department, which is directly administered by the hospital president and specialized operation guided by a professor of respiratory medicine, has been key to our success in managing and treating COVID-19 patients. Our hospital’s emergency-response mode could provide a reference for other hospitals and cities in this epidemic situation.

        <p>
            Human beings are constantly struggling with various epidemics. Although we gained a lot of experience and success, in the face of the new epidemic, we still inevitably face pressure from public health, politics, and the economy. Case fatality ratio (CFR) received widespread attention as one of the indicators describing the severity of the epidemic and evaluating treatment options. However, due to the ongoing epidemic situation and the constant changes in the death and diagnosis data, no scientific method for this situation to calculate the CFR exists. This study proposes a method for estimating CFR in the continuation of the epidemic. CFR is estimated by ""ratio of the cumulative number of deaths before j days from a given day to the sum of the number of patients discharged from a given day and the cumulative number of deaths before j days from a given day "". Take the ongoing outbreak of COVID COVID-19 in December 2019 as an example. The results show that, regardless of the size of the estimated value or its changing trend, the estimated CFR given by the new method shows better stability and better reflects the true situation of the case fatality rate; additionally, the improvement of medical conditions can also be clearly reflected in the change in valuation. When j = 10, according to the data of March 10, the CFR of COVIDCOVID-19 in Wuhan, China and China (excluding Hubei)is 6.23%,4.46%, and 0.87%, respectively. This method of estimating CFR can be used in time to evaluate the therapeutic effect of different medical schemes and different regions, which is of great value and significance for the decision decision-making in the epidemicprevention and control.Authors Wanling Hu, Xiaoyun Liu, and Tao Wang contributed equally to this work

            Background: During the outbreak of a disease caused by a pathogen with unknown characteristics, the uncertainty of its progression parameters can be reduced by devising methods that, based on rational assumptions, exploit available information in order to provide actionable insights. Methods: In this study, performed few (~6) weeks into the outbreak of COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2), data publicly available on the Internet including daily reported cases of confirmed infections, deaths and recoveries are fed into an algorithm that matches confirmed cases with deaths and recoveries, in order to calculate average time-intervals. Unmatched cases are adjusted based on the matched cases calculation. Results: The mean time-to-recovery calculated from all globally reported cases was found 18.01 days (SD 3.31 days) for the matched cases and 18.29 days (SD 2.73 days), taking under consideration the adjusted unmatched cases as well. Conclusion:The experimental results indicate that the proposed method, in combination with expert knowledge and informed calculated assumptions, could provide a meaningful calculated average time-to-recovery figure, which can be used as an evidence-based estimation to support the containment and mitigation policy decisions.

        <p>
            BACKGROUND: An outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) was initially emerged in Wuhan city, and subsequently spread throughout China. Then the epidemic is rapidly circulating in a few other countries at present. So it is very urgent to delineate the clinical characteristics of these affected patients. METHODS: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of this new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a cross-sectional study was executed with 459 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wenzhou, China, from January 27 to February 12, 2020. RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 48.0 years, and 46.8% were females. 37.5% of patients had a history of residence in Wuhan. Fever (72.1%) and cough (43.6%) were the most frequent symptoms. We also found that there were three kinds of unconventional patients including 4.4% of total confirmed patients who were asymptomatic, 7.8% patients who had no link to Wuhan city but contact with individuals from Wuhan without any symptoms at the time of contact, and 10.7% who had no link to Wuhan city nor a history of intimate contact with patients or individuals from Wuhan without any symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings presented the possibility of asymptomatic carriers affected with SARS-CoV-2, and this phenomenon suggested that chances of uncontrollable transmission in the larger population might be higher than formerly estimated, and transmission by these three kinds of unconventional patients in Wenzhou may be one of the characteristics of infection in other Chinese cities outside the Wuhan epidemic area.

            Background: A novel coronavirus spread starting late 2019 from the capital of the Hubei province in China to the rest of the country, then to most of the world. To anticipate future trends in the development of the epidemic, we explore here, based on public records of infected persons how variation in the virus tropism could end up in different patterns, warranting specific way to handle the epidemic. Methods: We use a compartmental model to describe the evolution of an individual through several possible states: susceptible, infected, alternative infection, detected and removed. We t the parameters of the model to the existing data taking into account significant quarantine changes where necessary. Results: The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms and a second propagation route are compatible with available data. For Hong Kong, Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet and the epidemic size limited. Conclusions: The alternative infection tropism (the gut tropism) and a secondary propagation route hypotheses are validated using a model fitted by the available data. Corresponding prevention measures that take into account both routes should be implemented to the benefit of epidemic control.

Studies thus far have shown origination in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal association has not been confirmed. The reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines are being discussed for reducing the transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment is proven effective, hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus.

        <p>
            Epidemic forecasting provides an opportunity to predict geographic disease spread and counts when an outbreak occurs and plays a key role in preventing or controlling their adverse impact. However, conventional prediction models based on complex mathematical modeling rely on the estimation of model parameters, which yields unreliable and unsustainable results. Herein, we proposed a simple model for predicting the epidemic transmission dynamics based on nonlinear regression of the epidemic growth rate and iterative methods, which is applicable to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak under the strict control measures of the Chinese government. Our model yields reliable and accurate results as confirmed by the available data: we predicted that the total number of infections in mainland China would be 91,253, and the maximum number of beds required for hospitalized patients would be 62,794. We inferred that the inflection point (when the growth rate turns from positive to negative) of the epidemic across China would be mid-February, and the end of the epidemic would be in late March. This model is expected to contribute to resourceallocation and planning in the health sector while providing a theoretical basis forgovernments to respond to future global health crises or epidemics.

Face masks are being used by individuals who are not medically diagnosed with COVID-19 as a means to limit the spread of COVID-19 in several countries around the world. While some countries recommend the use of face masks, other countries do not recommend their use to limit the transmission of COVID-19 among this specific population. Because of contradicting recommendations provided by health authorities of different countries, this paper aims to investigate the availability of scientific evidence on the effectiveness of face mask use in limiting the spread of COVID-19 among individuals who are not medically diagnosed with COVID-19 through a systematic review search. This paper will further discuss concerns around current recommendations provided to those who are not medically diagnosed with COVID-19 regarding face mask use in the context of available evidence.

To carry out the systematic review on the effectiveness of face mask use in limiting the spread of COVID-19 among individuals who are not medically diagnosed with COVID-19, databases Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for relevant studies. Two groups of keywords were combined: those relating to face masks and COVID-19.
<bold>Results</bold>
The systematic review search did not find any studies that investigated the effectiveness of face mask use in limiting the spread of this specific virus, COVID-19 among this specific population, those who are not medically diagnosed with COVID-19.
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
In light of the finding of this systematic review search, which is a lack of scientific evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in limiting the spread of COVID-19 among those who are not medically diagnosed with COVID-19, the significance of this finding is highlighted and extensively discussed in this paper. This paper calls for, but does not limit to; 1) evidence-based recommendations; 2) considerations when providing recommendations in the absence of evidence; 3) evidence and knowledge transparency on current recommendations with the public; 4) global alignment on recommendations; and 5) further research.

        <p>
            Background Coronaviruses cause respiratory diseases in many animals, including humans. Spike protein is an important component of coronavirus structure and the formation of ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2)–spike complex mediates virus entry to host cells. C–type lectin family are widely distribute on the surface of human cells and have been shown to activate the immune system. In this article, we first illustrate why we can “learn from SARS” with phylogenetic analysis. Then, we use SARS spike protein structure, to inferring our molecular docking experiment, revealing the potential capacity of C–type lectin to directly interact with spike protein obstructs the formation of spike–ACE2 complex. Considering the expression profile of C–type lectin family changing significantly during infection, we predict certain members of this kind of protein as potential therapeutic target and verify their assumed function by inferring an C–type lectin–dependent CD4/CD28 T cell survival molecular network with endogenous molecular network theory (EMT) and comparing the predicted expression trend corresponding to each molecular with experiment data. Methods Alignments are inferred by MAFFT V7 ( G–ins–i, Blosom). Maximum likelihood analyses and bootstrap test carried out by RAXML V8.2 ML+BP online platform. Protein structure is predicted by SWISSMODELLING online platform. Molecular docking experiment is carried out by Z–dock Version 3.0.2. C–type lectin–dependent CD4/CD28 T cell Network is inferred by EMT theory. Result Our molecular docking experiment revealing the potential capacity of C–type lectin to directly interact with spike protein obstructs the formation of spike–ACE2 complex. Based on the expression profile of C–type lectin family during infection, we predicting certain member of this kind of protein as potential therapeutic target such as Clec7a, Clec12a and Clec11a, corresponding immune cell types such as CD4/CD28 T cell simulated by EMT theory and verified by experiment data, antigen adjuvant with similar C–type lectin receptor–TDM and some immune–boosting drugs–radix sophorae, lactoferrin and Astragalus membranaceus, for future testing.  Conclusions C–type lectin and their corresponding immune cells predicted in this work may be the potential therapeutic targets for the disease caused by COVID–19. C–lectin with the capacity of directly interact with spike protein inhibiting the formation of ACE2–spike complex may be the way they execute anti–virus function. The corresponding cell type such as CD4/CD28 T cell may participate and against virus while Clec7a, Clec12a and Clec11a presumed capacity for facilitating CD4/CD28 T cell survival during infection being verified by EMT combining with experiment data. Our prediction at least suggest the possibility of activating organ’s immunizing power to prevent from COVID–19 and the drugs we suggested are all need to be further tested.

            <bold>Background:</bold> In this study, we aimed to find out the features of the maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Blood Purification Center of Wuhan No.1 Hospital, Hubei Province, China, and provide evidences for clinical treatment.<bold>Methods:</bold> We collected the data of all the MHD patients in this hemodialysis center by February 20, 2020, including those infected with COVID-19. These patients were divided into three groups: the control group (537 cases), confirmed group (66 cases) and suspected group (24 cases). We compared the relevant data of the three groups and analyzed the factors that may affect the possibility of catching COVID-19.<bold>Results: 1. </bold>By February 20, 2020, there were 627 MHD patients in the Hemodialysis Center of Wuhan No.1 Hospital. The prevalence rate of the COVID-19 was 14.35% (90/627, including 66 confirmed cases and 24 suspected cases); the fatality rate 13.33% (12/90, including 12 death cases); the mortality rate 1.91% (12/627).<bold>2. </bold>The comparison between the three groups revealed the following results: weekly hemodialysis duration (WHD), ultrafiltration volume (UFV) and ultrafiltration rate (UFR) of the confirmed group were obviously lower than those of the control and suspected groups (<italic>P</italic>＜0.05); the neutrophil ratio (N%), neutrophil (N#), monocyte (M#) and total carbon dioxide (TCO<sub>2</sub>) were significantly higher than those of the control group while the lymphocyte ratio (L%) was much lower (<italic>P</italic>＜0.05).<bold>3. </bold>The lung CT scans found three common features: bilateral abnormalities (81.54%), multiple abnormalities (84.62%) and patchy opacity (61.54%).<bold>4. </bold>The binary logstic regression analysis showed that diabetes (<italic>OR</italic>=5.404,95% <italic>CI</italic> 1.950～14.976, <italic>P</italic>=0.001) and hypertension (<italic>OR</italic>=3.099,95% <italic>CI</italic> 1.380～6.963, <italic>P</italic>=0.006) are independent risk factors for MHD patients to be infected with COVID-19; WHD (<italic>OR</italic>=0.846,95% <italic>CI</italic> 0.737～0.970, <italic>P</italic>=0.017), UFR (<italic>OR</italic>=0.012,95% <italic>CI</italic> 0.002～0.058, <italic>P</italic>＜0.001) and serum ferritin (SF, <italic>OR</italic>=0.823,95% <italic>CI</italic> 0.748～0.906, <italic>P</italic>＜0.001) are independent protective factors.<bold>Conclusion:</bold> MHD patients with diabetes or hypertension are more likely to be infected with COVID-19.

        <p>
            Objective: Based on the clinical characteristics of infected patients with novel coronavirus in secondary epidemic areas, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers for the evaluation of novel coronavirus-infected patients, guide the diagnosis and treatment of this disease in secondary epidemic areas and provide a reference for the clinical prevention and control of this epidemic situation.Methods: The clinical data of 33 patients with respiratory symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus in Wenzhou city from January 15 to February 12, 2020, were thoroughly reviewed. At the onset of the disease, we found that the primary symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue, chest tightness, chest pain and specific blood test results. According to the patients’ histories, the patients were divided into two groups: those who spent time in the main epidemic area and those who did not spend time in the main epidemic area. The differences in the clinical manifestations between these two groups were analyzed.Results: The main clinical symptoms of patients infected with novel coronavirus in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms. After grouping patients based on the presence or absence of residency in or travel history to the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference between the baseline data of these two groups, and there were no significant differences in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Some patients had abnormally increased serum amyloid protein A (SAA). There were statistically significant differences in the leukocyte count/C-reactive protein, monocyte ratio/C-reactive protein, neutrophil count/C-reactive protein, monocyte count/C-reactive protein and hemoglobin/C-reactive protein values between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05).Conclusion: Respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms were the primary symptoms of novel coronavirus infection in the secondary epidemic area; these symptoms are not typical. The abnormal increase in serum amyloid protein (SAA) may be used as an auxiliary index for diagnosis and treatment. CRP changes before other blood parameters and thus may be an effective evaluation index for patients with COVID-19 infection.

            <bold>Objective: </bold>Novel coronavirus (nCoV, SARS-CoV-2) infection becomes a world-wide epidemic which has complicated and diversified symptoms, but no special treatment. In this study, diagnosis and treatment of family clustering nCoV infection were analyzed.<bold>Methods: </bold>The Sichuan Suining Central Hospital received 11 patients with confirmed nCoV virus infection from 4 families during January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020 to February 20<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Their clinical symptoms, treatment conditions and changes of disease state were reviewed in the present study.<bold>Results</bold>: In all 4 families, there were 1-2 members in each family who had contact with epidemic disease. Clinical manifestations were: 3 cases had debilitation only, 1 case had cough only, 1 case had diarrhea (a child patient of four years old), 5 cases had fever and cough, and 1 case had blood-stained sputum. According to image changes, no image change was observed in 1 child patient. Multiple focal ground-glass opacities were detected from 2 patients and multiple patchy shadows were observed from 8 patients, especially in lung periphery. Complications with basic diseases: there were hypertension in 3 cases, diabetes in 2 cases, and hypertension and diabetes in 1 case. Moreover, there’s one patient who had rheumatic heart disease and received mitral and aortic valve replacement 2 years ago. There’s another one who had depression and suicidal tendency. All 11 cases divided into mild type (1 child patient), moderate type (8 patients), severe type (1 patient) and critical type (1 patient). Treatment: the mild child patient (4 years old) was administrated with 2.75ml lopinavir / ritonavir oral liquid (twice per day) and intravenous drip of 0.17g ribavirin injection (1ml: 0.1g*10pcs/box) every 12h for one week. Meanwhile, the child was asked to take azithromycin orally. 7 moderate patients were treated with intravenous drip of 0.5g ribavirin injection (1ml: 0.1g*10pcs/box) every 12h (twice per day) and two pieces of lopinavir/ritonavior (twice per day) for 7-10 days. In the same time, patients were given with reasonable amount of antibiotics by oral or intravenous drip. 1 severe patient and 1 critical patent were treated with 5,000,000 U recombinant human interferon α2b injection (3,000,000 U/pc) and aerosol inhalation of 2ml sterile water for injection (5ml*50 pcs/ box), twice per day. Besides, they took 2 pieces of lopinavir/ritonavior, twice per day. The whole treatment program lasted for 6-12 days, accompanied with appropriate amount of intravenous drip of antibiotics. The critical patient was also provided with mechanical ventilation. During the treatment, severe and critical patients were treated by resochin for 4-5 days for evident respiratory symptoms. One moderate patient was treated with 2 pieces of lopinavir/ritonavior, twice per day. In the same time, it was administrated by intravenous drip of antibiotics. However, resochin treatment was applied for positive novel coronavirus nucleic acid of respiratory sputum specimen after 11 days of treatment. Discharge: After treatment, patients with body temperatures of all patients recovered to normal level, and respiratory symptoms and digestive tract symptoms relieved significantly, significant coefficient of exudative lesion at lung according to chest CT and negative novel coronavirus nucleic acid of continuous two respiratory sputum specimens (sampling interval was at least 1 day) were allowed to be discharged. Adverse reactions: 4 patients had loose stools and abdominal discomfort, and another 2 cases had diarrhea.<bold>Conclusions:</bold> SARS-CoV-2 infection have complicated and diversified symptoms, which shall be identified according to epidemic history and novel coronavirus nucleic acid test. In particular, the whole family in which there’s a patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 shall be isolated for screening in addition to the patient. The lopinavir/ritonavior administration combined with ribavirin or recombinant Human Interferon (RHI) α2b is effective, accompanied with mild adverse reaction. If lopinavir/ritonavior administration and / or combined with ribavirin and RHI α2b is invalid, adding resochin might be effective.

        <p>
            Recent studies have reported that 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients with lung cancer have a higher risk of severe events than patients without cancer. In this study, we investigated the expression of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the cellular protease transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and their associations with prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). We found that there are significant differences in susceptibility to SAR-CoV-2 among each age stages of individuals with the expression of ACE2. ACE2 was also high expressed in LUAD and LUSC, and this suggests that COVID-19 patients with lung cancers are susceptible to SAR-CoV-2 infection. Our data showed the differential gene expression level and gene coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 among each subtypes and pathological stages of LUAD and LUSC and the data were verified by meta-analysis, gene expression omnibus (GEO) data and animal models results.

        <p>
            A new mysterious coronavirus outbreak started last month in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) termed the new virus strain 2019-nCoV to be the seventh reported human coronaviruses (HCoV). A seafood market in Wuhan city, central China was the starting point of the emergence with unknown animal causes the first animal to human infection. Until today 904 confirmed deaths and more than 40000 cases confirmed in China and 28 countries. There is a massive fear of the human to human transmission of 2019-nCoV that reported last week by the Chinese government. The most famous two strains of HCoV are the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV). The former had emerged in China in 2002 while the latter emerged in the Middle East region in 2012 and south Korea in 2015. In this study, the newly emerged 2019-nCoV papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>) is targeted by anti-SARS PL<sup>pro</sup> drugs and the anti-Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-structural protein 3 (NS3) serine protease drugs. Sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to get a valid model for 2019-nCoV PL<sup>pro</sup>. The results suggest the effectiveness of the anti-SARS drugs (GRL-0667, GRL-0617, and Mycophenolic acid) and the anti-HCV drugs (Grazoprevir, Telaprevir, and Boceprevir) as potent inhibitors against the newly emerged coronavirus.

        <p>
            <bold>Background:</bold> A new human coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 emerged during December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities and abroad, which may cause the global outbreak. Chang Sha is the nearest provincial capital city to Wuhan, the first case of COVID-19 in Changsha was diagnosed on January 21, 2020. Estimating the transmissibility and forecasting the trend of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 under the prevention and control measures in Changsha could inform evidence based decisions to policy makers. 
<bold>Methods:</bold> Data were collected from the Health Commission of Changsha and Hunan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A Susceptible-exposed-infections/ asymptomatic- removed (SEIAR) model was established to simulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Changsha. Berkeley Madonna 8.3.18 were employed for the model simulation and prediction, while the curve fitting problem was solved by the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method, with a tolerance of 0.001.
<bold>Results:</bold> In this study, we found that Rt was 2.05 from January 21 to 27 and reduced to 0.2 after January 27, 2020 in Changsha. The prediction results showed that when no obvious prevention and control measures were applied, the total number of patients in Changsha would reach the maximum (2.27 million) on the 79th day after the outbreak, and end in about 240 days; When measures have not been fully launched, the total number of patients would reach the maximum (1.60 million) on the 28th day after the outbreak, and end in about 110 days; When measures have been fully launched, the total number of patients would reach the maximum (234) on the 23rd day after the outbreak, and end in about 60 days. 
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Changsha is in a controllable stage under current prevention and control measures, it is predicted that the cumulative patients would reach the maximum of 234 on February 12, and the outbreak would be over on 20 March in Changsha. With the fully implementation of prevention and control measures, it could effectively reduce the peak value, short the time to peak and duration of the outbreak.

        <p>
            The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a series of clinical settings from non-symptomatic viral carriers/spreaders to severe illness characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1,2. A sizable part of patients with COVID-19 have mild clinical symptoms at the early stage of infection, but the disease progression may become quite rapid in the later stage with ARDS as the common manifestation and followed by critical multiple organ failure, causing a high mortality rate of 7-10% in the elderly population with underlying chronic disease1-3. The pathological investigation in the lungs and other organs of fatal cases is fundamental for the mechanistic understanding of severe COVID-19 and the development of specific therapy in these cases. Gross anatomy and molecular markers allowed us to identify, in two fatal patients subject to necropsy, the main pathological features such as exudation and hemorrhage, epithelium injuries, infiltration of macrophages and fibrosis in the lungs. The mucous plug with fibrinous exudate in the alveoli and the activation of alveolar macrophages were characteristic abnormalities. These findings shed new insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and justify the use of interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor antagonists and convalescent plasma with neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 for severe patients.Authors Chaofu Wang, Jing Xie, Lei Zhao, Xiaochun Fei, Heng Zhang, and Yun Tan contributed equally to this work.

Rapid identification of immune epitopes would be an efficient way to screen the candidates for vaccine development at the time of an impending pandemic. This study aimed to predict the protective epitopes with bioinformatic methods and resources for vaccine development.  <bold>Methods</bold>: ABCpred and BepiPred servers were utilized for sequential B-cell epitope analysis. Discontinuous B-cell epitopes were predicted via DISCTOPE server. IEDB server was utilized for HLA-1 and HLA-2 binding peptides computation. Surface accessibility, antigenicity, and other important features of forcasted epitopes were characterized for immunogen potential evaluation.<bold>Results</bold>: A total of 63 sequential B-cell epitopes on spike protein were predicted and 3 peptides (333-338, 648-663, 1064-1079) exhibited high antigenicity score and good surface accessibility in our modeling. 8 residues within spike protein (Gly<sup>184</sup>, Gly<sup>502</sup>, Lys<sup>558</sup>, Pro<sup>561</sup>, Pro<sup>809</sup>, Ser<sup>810</sup>, Lys<sup>811</sup>, Pro<sup>812</sup>) are forcasted as components of discontinuous B-cell epitopes. The bioinformatic analysis of HLA binding peptides within nucleocapsid protein produced 81 and 64 peptides being able to bind class-I and class-II molecule respectively.

        <p>
            Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is highly contagious disease caused by virus COVID19. The first case is reported in Wuhan, China, with rapid spreading all over the world and the rate of mortality is also high. SARS-CoV and another human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63 has large spike protein (S) on the virion surface mediates both cell attachment and membrane fusion with receptor sites present on host cell-surface zinc peptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Methodology: In the present study, molecular docking studies have been carried out to assess the interaction between the novel corona virus protein COVID19 with stranded drugs used for influenza, anti-retro viral therapy and malaria drugs by using Accelerys discovery studio 2.5, followed by analysis of data. The present study will help to design the drugs against the corona virus and understand the mode of treatment for SARS. Results: All the four-protein receptor of COVID 19 proteins at particular amino acid position binds to the NH and H atom of anti-retro viral therapy drugs (Atazanavir, Doravirine, Emitricitabine, Entravirine, Raltegravir, Tenofavir Disproxil, and Zidovudin) and anti-malaria drug (Hydroxy chloroquine) with less hydrogen bond distance with maximum docking scores which indicates that these compounds can acts against the COVID19 virus. Gene mania network help to design the novel drugs and diagnosis. Conclusions: This is first report to show the molecular docking interaction between the COVID19 protein with stranded drugs of anti -viral treatment. anti-viral drugs Atazanavir, Doravirine, Emitricitabine, Entravirine, Raltegravir, Tenofavir Disproxil, and Zidovudin and malaria drug Hydroxy chloroquine has more strong binding with COVID19 protein receptors.

        <p>
            <bold>Background: </bold>Coronavirus 2019-nCoV was first identified in China in 2019. One of the most important indices noticed by experts, policymakers and managers which is daily evaluated in epidemics and a lot of judgments are made based on it, is case fatality rate (CFR) index of the disease. CFR can change during epidemics. This study aims to calculate CFR index for nCov-2019 in Iran and answer the following question: Is it right to base judgment on CFR all the time during epidemics and is it right to judge based on that since the outbreak of an epidemic?<bold>Methods:</bold> This research is a descriptive study. Its required data was obtained from the website of The Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran from February 20<sup>th</sup> 2020 until March 14<sup>th</sup> 2020. CFR index was calculated when the death toll of a disease is divided by the total number of people infected by that disease. Excel 2013 software was used to a1nalyze the data.<bold>Results</bold>: According to the findings of this study, In Iran, until March 14<sup>th</sup> 2020, 11364 people have been infected by Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and 514 people died of it. CFR index had a descending trend and it was 100%, 18.6%, 8.8%, 3.1%, 3.3%, 4.5% on the first, fifth, tenth, fifteenth, twentieth and twenty fifth day, respectively. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: In emerging epidemics, an index must not be based to judge a health system’s performance until that epidemics condition has not been clarified. It would be suggested that in the outbreak of an epidemic, specifically emerging diseases, CFR must not be the base of judgment. Making judgments, specifically, in the outbreak of emerging epidemics based on fatality rate can lead to an information bias.

            <bold>Background:</bold> Recently the 2019-nCov pneumonia outbreak in China then the world. Search Query performs well in forecasting the epidemics. It is still a suspense whether search query can forecast the drift and the inflexion in 2019-nCov pneumonia. Based on the Baidu Search Index, we propose three prediction models: composite Index, composite Index with filtering (Fourier Transform) and suspected NCP(Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia) cases. With the trained models, we predict the new confirmed cases of 2019-nCov of forecast-period from Feb. 3rd to 9th. Attempting to identify the next peak period, we further estimate 10 day out-of-sample of the new confirmed cases from Feb. 10th to 19th.<bold>Results:</bold> We select 16 search queries related to NCP and calculate the correlation coefficient. The maximum correlation coefficient of search queries is above 0.8. The composite Index performs 10 days ahead of the new confirmed cases. With the In-sample prediction, the result demonstrates that the predictive model of composite index with filtering performs the best with MAPE 24.98% and RMSE 192.71. By contract, the predictive model of the suspected NCP cases is calculated with the prediction error of MAPE 8.82% and RMSE 368.51(almost twice the best model). With the Out-of-sample prediction, we monitor that there might be a peak value in Feb. 16th to 17th in the next ten days.<bold>Conclusion:</bold> With noise filtering, the predictive model can forecast the new confirmed NCP cases more accurately. However, the filtering eliminates the violent fluctuations of the series and cannot capture the rising and declining details of the predicted values. On contrast, the prediction accuracy based on search composite index is sensitive to prediction of peak and valley although its prediction error is larger. These two predictive models can be combined: monitoring the further volatility trend with filtering model while identifying the inflexion with composite model.

        <p>
            SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and has caused the pandemic respiratory disease, COVID-19. Following what is presumed to be an initial zoonotic transmission event, the virus is now spreading efficient in humans. Very little is known about the susceptibility of domestic mammals kept as pets to this virus. Samples were collected over a 13-day period from a 17 year-old neutered male Pomeranian in Hong Kong SA that was taken into isolation after two members of the household tested positive for the virus. Nasal swabs were consistently positive on the five occasions the dog was tested using quantitative RT- PCR with viral loads between 7.5xE2 to 2.6 x10E4 RNA copies per mL of sample. The dog remained asymptomatic. Cultures attempted on three RT-PCR positive nasal samples were negative. Gene sequences from samples from two household members were identical. The viral sequence from the dog differed at three nucleotide positions; two of these resulted in amino acid changes but their significance is yet to be determined. Seroconversion was not detected but this was expected given the asymptomatic infection and low virus load. The evidence suggests that this is an instance of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-COV-2. It is likely that we could see similar events in other infected households. We do not have information yet on whether this virus can cause illness in dogs but no specific signs were seen in this dog. Whether infected dogs could transmit the virus to other animals or back to humans remains unknown. In this case it did not appear to have occurred.

We report here five cases of COVID-19 infection patients in our clinical practices who are medically stable and presumed to successfully “cleared” the virus after antiviral treatments. <bold>Case presentation:</bold> The clinical evaluation depends on the viral nucleic acid test in respiratory specimens by real-time PCR reverse transcription (RT-PCR) assays according to the authorized guidance. We found that the stool samples of these cured patients remain positive in RT-PCR assay while the virus is undetectable in respiratory specimens. RT-PCR molecular diagnostic assay was designed to specifically detect the presence of viral RNA. Thus, the positive result in the fecal specimens implies the existence of viable virions with the patients. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This highlights the importance to look closely at the assessment standard of medical treatment, as well as the need for reevaluation of the criteria for the initial screening, prevention, and care of patients with this emerging infection.

            The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously designated as 2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused global concern1. Currently, there are no clinically approved specific drugs or vaccines available for this virus. The viral polymerase is a promising target for developing broad- spectrum antiviral drugs. Here, based on the highly similar structure of SARS- CoV non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) polymerase subunit2, we applied virtual screen for the available compounds, including both the FDA-approved and under- clinic drugs, to identify potential antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2. We found two drugs, the clinically approved anti-fungi drug Caspofungin Acetate (Cancidas) and the oncolytic peptide LTX-315, can bind SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 protein to block the polymerase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Further live virus assay revealed that both Caspofungin Acetate and LTX-315 can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vero cells. These findings present promising drug candidates for treatment of related diseases and would also stimulate the development of pan- coronavirus antiviral agents.Authors Min Wang, Fei Ye, Jiaqi Su, Jingru Zhao, and Bin Yuan contributed equally to this work.

            Backgrounds: To determine the differences in clinical manifestations and biomarker levels of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, including common patients and severe (serious and critical) patients.Methods: A total of 89 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed and treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. We clinically classified the patients and collected data. Findings: There was a higher proportion of confirmed cases in patients with type A blood (44.8%). There were no obvious differences in number of lung lobes involved in the lesion between the patients with or without a positive nucleic acid test (p&gt;0.05).There were obvious differences in contact history (p&lt;0.001), duration of symptoms (p=0.004), and respiratory rate (p=0.029) between the patients with or without a positive nucleic acid test. According to the results of the nucleic acid diagnosis test, there were no obvious differences in the number of lung lobes involved in the lesion and all items of routine blood, liver, and kidney function tests between the patients with or without positive nucleic acid tests (all p&gt;0.05). Between the common patients and severe patients, there were obvious differences in age (p=0.006), duration of symptoms (p=0.001), diastolic blood pressure (p=0.046), lymphocyte count (p＜0.0001), neutrophil count (p=0.019), albumin (p=0.002), lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.007), calcium (p＜0.0001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.004), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p=0.021), international standard ratio (p=0.020), and CD3 (p=0.001), CD3+CD4 (p=0.006), and CD3+CD8 (p=0.001) levels. In patients infected with SARS-COV-2, the number of lung lobes involved in the lesion were positively correlated with lymphocytes (R=0.261, p=0.044); the body mass index (BMI) values were positively correlated with the number of lung lobes involved in the lesion (R=0.320, P=0.034); the age (R=0.391, p&lt;0.001) and respiratory rate (R=0.352, p=0.001) were positively correlated with neutrophil count; and the age (R=0.349, p=0.001) and the number of lung lobes involved in the lesion (R=0.422, p=0.001) were positively correlated with CRP.Conclusion: Patients with blood type A may be more susceptible to SARS-COV-2. The decrease in lymphocytes may indicate the aggravation of COVID-19, whereas the number of lung lobes involved in the lesion may not be a valid criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.

            Background: Outbreak of COVID-19 has brought catastrophe to huge numbers of families. However, even though numerous tragedies occurred, there were few reports about family cluster infection in the academic journals. Methods: The electronic medical records of 10 COVID-19 patients in a big family were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: These 10 patients, 4 males and 6 females, were infected through two successive family feasts during Spring Festival. The infection source was a family member at asymptomatic state, who lived in Hubei but travelled to Nanjing. The median age of these 10 patients was 61.5, with the oldest 95 and youngest 38. The incubation period varied from 3 to 17 days, with the median of 5.5. Of them, 2 patients were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms at onset were fever (6/10) and dry cough (6/10). All of them displayed lesions on the chest CT. 40% of them had leukopenia, neutropenia and lymphopenia. After anti-virus treatment, all the patients significantly improved and were discharged. Conclusions: SARS-Cov-2 was highly contagious and so crafty that a varied incubation period did exist. Part of patients might be asymptomatic, which was the potential source of transmission. More measures for protection or quarantine should be taken at home if family member had travel history nearby the epidemic area. Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-Cov-2, family cluster, asymptomatic, incubation period.

            Since beginning of this century, there have already been three zoonotic outbreaks caused by beta coronaviruses (CoV), SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the newly identified 2019-nCoV in late 2019, Wuhan, China. As to Feb 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020, there are over 40,000 confirmed cases and over 900 deaths. However, little is known about the biology of this newly emerged virus. Here we developed a lentiviral based pseudovirus system for S protein of 2019-nCoV to study virus entry in BSL2 settings. First, we confirmed that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the main entry receptor for 2019-nCoV. Second, we found that 2019-nCoV S protein mediated entry on 293/hACE2 cells was mainly through endocytosis, and PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L are critical for virus entry. Third, 2019-nCoV S protein is less stable than SARS-CoV, and it could trigger protease-independent and receptor dependent cell-cell fusion, which might help virus rapidly spread from cell to cell. Finally and more importantly, polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibodies T62 effectively inhibited entry of SARS-CoV S pseudovirions, but almost had no effect on entry of 2019-nCoV S pseudovirions. Further studies using sera from one recovered SARS-CoV patient and five 2019-nCoV patients showed that there was only limited cross-neutralization activities between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV sera, suggesting that recovery from one infection might not protect against the other. Our results present potential targets for development of drugs and vaccines for 2019-nCoV.

            <bold>Background: </bold>In December 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia-19 (COVID-19) was discovered in the viral pneumonia cases that occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China; and then quickly spread inside and outside of Wuhan and even other countries. This report describes the clinical course of two patients who had COVID-19.<bold>Case presentation:</bold> The first case was a typical COVID-19 case. A 66-year-old female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of fever with coughing, white sputum, runny nose and dizziness. She had contacted with a COVID-19 patient, her daughter-in-law who was diagnosed with COVID-19 two days before. Chest CT showed typical COVID-19 CT imaging. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive nucleic acid test. The second case was a 50-year-old male with a 2-day history of fever and dry coughing. He denied having been to Wuhan. Chest CT also showed typical COVID-19 CT imaging. He accepted COVID-19 nucleic acid test using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of his throat swab sampling 7 times and the test results remained controversial. Eventually, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after 5 days.<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Chest CT examination has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 clinically, particularly when nucleic acid test is negative. Chest CT should be considered for the COVID-19 screening, comprehensive evaluation and following-up and patients could benefit from effective treatment in time.

        <p>
            Background The outbreak of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused enormous stress among the public in China. Intellectual input from various aspects is needed to control the COVID-19, including the understanding of the public’s emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study examined three cognitive appraisals (i.e., knowledge, perceived severity and perceived controllability of the COVID-19) and their associations with a wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes among the Chinese public. Methods Participants were 4607 citizens (age range: 17–90 years, Mage=23.71 years) from 31 provinces in China and they took part in an online survey. Results The results showed that the public’s emotional and behavioural reactions were slightly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19. Moreover, the public had limited participation in the events regarding the COVID-19 but actively engaged in precautionary behaviour. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the three appraisals were differentially related to the outcome variables. Conclusions The findings highlight the utility of cognitive appraisal, as a core process of coping stress, in explaining the public’s emotion and behaviour in the encounter of public health concern. Practically, the findings facilitate the government and practitioners to design and deliver targeted intervention programs to the public affected by the COVID-19.

            <bold>Background: </bold>In December 2019, Wuhan witnessed the outbreak of an “unexplained pneumonia” caused by a novel coronavirus strain infection and was dubbed the COVID-19 by the WHO. The disease quickly spread to China. This study aimed to investigate the disease’s evolving epidemiological history, as well as analyze the clinical and CT imaging characteristics, treatment regimens, and patients’ prognosis.<bold>Methods: </bold>This was a retrospective study whose cases were 64 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The clinical data were obtained from patients who were admitted to the isolation ward from 21 January 2020 to 19 February 2020.<bold>Results: </bold>60 out of 64 patients had a definitive history of exposure to people who had traveled from Wuhan City. The median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 3.9±1.9 days. The initial symptoms included fever (46/64), dry cough (38/64), fatigue or myalgia (23/64), sore throat (10/64), diarrhea (3/64) along with late-onset symptoms like chest pains (2/64) and headaches (2/64). The majority of the patients (43/64) had normal white blood cell counts while 29.7 % (19/64) had leukopenia. Only two patients (3.1 %) presented with leukocytosis. 58 of the 64patients had abnormal radiological findings on chest CTs. The first chest CTs (within 2 days) was more sensitive in detecting COVID-19 infection (85.9 %) compared to the initial RT-PCR (56.3 %; p&lt;0.01). The CTs showed lesions in multiple lung lobes in three-quarters of the patients while 15.6 % had lesions localized to one lobe. Most of the lesions were typically dense with ground-glass opacity co-existing with consolidation or cord-like shadows. Most of these patients (50/64) have recovered and got discharged giving a mean length of hospital stay of 13.5±4.8 days. Our hospital unit has not reported any COVID-19 related death so far. <bold>Conclusions: </bold>Early intervention in COVID-19 disease improves patients’ prognosis. Our data demonstrate the superiority of early radiological tests ahead of RT-PCR. The initial and dynamic CT changes in COVID-19 patients along with other clinical data shared above can better guide clinical decision making.

            <bold>Background: </bold>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging viral disease. Here, we reported the clinical features, management, and short-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Wenzhou, an area outside Wuhan.<bold>Methods:</bold> Patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department of Ruian People's Hospital in Wenzhou, from January 21 to February 7, 2020, were recruited. Medical data on epidemiological history, demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, computerized tomography (CT) examination, treatment, and short-term outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Blood biochemistry and routine tests were examined using standard methods and automatic machines. CT examination was performed again for several times during the hospitalization as necessary.<bold>Results: </bold>A total of 67 confirmed COVID-19 cases were diagnosed; 64 (95.4%) were common cases and three (4.5%) severe cases. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (86.6%), cough (77.6%), productive cough (52.2%), chest distress (17.9%), and sore throat (11.9%), followed by diarrhea (7.4%), headache (7.4%), shortness of breath (6.0%), dizziness (4.5%), muscular soreness (4.5%), and running nose (4.5%). Thirty patients (47.8%) had increased C-reactive protein levels. The CT radiographs at admission showed abnormal findings in 54 (80.6%) patients. The patients were treated mainly by oxygen therapy and antiviral drugs. By February 17, 2020, none of the 67 patients died and no infection occurred among medical staff in the department. Fifty-four (80.6%) patients were completely recovered and all others were improving.<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Cases in Wenzhou are mild, with good prognosis. Timely and appropriate screening, diagnosis, and treatment are the key to achieve the good outcomes.

        <p>
            Background: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. This study aims to report the clinical characteristics of children COVID-19 in Xiangyang, a city outside of Wuhan within Hubei Province. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the clinical manifestations, Chest CT imaging, and laboratory characteristics of confirmed cases of children with COVID-19 with WHO interim guidance in Xiangyang Central Hospital from Feb 1 to Mar 10, 2020. 10 children cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, and were analyzed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Mar 10, 2020. Results: 6 cases (60%) had never been to Wuhan but closely contacted with family members with confirmed COVID-19, and 4 cases (40%) had made short term trips to Wuhan alone without familial cluster. Most common symptoms was cough (50%) followed by fever (40%), 4 cases (40%) showed asymptomatic characteristics including 2 cases (20%) with abnormal chest CT imag e . 9 cases (90%) were mild type, only 1 case (10%) was moderate type, none of them progressed in severe or critically disease. 4 (40%) cases showed leucopenia but nonelymphopenia. Abnormalities on chest computed tomograms (CT) were detected among 8 cases (80%), 2 of 4 cases without obvious symptoms had abnormal chest CT. Conclusions: Children's infection is mainly caused by family clusters, and COVID-19 seems less likely to spread from children to adults.The clinical manifestations in children with COVID-19 are non-specific with milder symptoms and good outcomes.

        <p>
            <bold>Objective:</bold> 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) has become a global health emergency. However, the clinical presentations are not well characterized. The study aimed to describe clinical characteristics of 2019-nCov pneumonia with meta-analytic approach, and to identify risk factors for developing severe cases.<bold>Methods:</bold> The electronic databases of PubMed, Google Scholar and MedRxiv were searched from December 2019 to February 2020. Records were included if they reported clinical characteristics of 2019-nCov pneumonia. Studies using crowd sourcing data for mathematical modeling but not reporting clinical data were excluded. The study was reported according to the PRISMA guideline. Data were extracted by independent reviewers. Proportions and mean values were pooled across component studies by using the meta-analytic approach. Data were pooled with fixed or random-effects model as appropriate. Clinical characteristics such as age, gender, symptoms, treatment and mortality outcome were pooled across studies if appropriate. Risk factors for development of severe cases were reported.<bold>Results:</bold> A total of 13 studies involving 5,729 patients were included for quantitative analysis. The mean age of the study population was 50 years (95% CI: 47 to 53). The most common initial symptoms were cough (68.0%; 95% CI: 65.6 to 70.4%), followed by fever (56.5%; 95% CI: 53.9 to 58.9%), fatigue (42.5%; 95% CI: 39.9 to 45.1%) and anorexia (31.7%; 95% CI: 26.5 to 38.4%). The severe cases accounts for 22.5% of the whole population (95% CI: 21.4 to 23.6%). The overall mortality rate was 1.8% (95% CI: 1.5 to 2.2%), which was consistent with the real time epidemic tracking data. There was substantial heterogeneity across included studies (O = 0.84; p &lt; 0.001). A number of comorbidities and symptoms such as hypertension, COPD, dyspnea, elevated C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were found to be associated with increased risk of developing severe cases.<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study described clinical characteristics of the 2019-nCov pneumonia in a systematic way. Multiple risk factors were identified for severe cases.

            <bold>Background: </bold>Since December 2019, a severe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection (Coronavirus Disease 2019,COVID-19) has occurred in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread to the country and around the world. This study intends to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in a surrounding city of Wuhan.<bold>Methods: </bold>A retrospective study was conducted on 208 cases of COVID -19 patients from February 11, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in Xiaogan dongnan Hospital, collected basic information, history of exposure, medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory indicators and pulmonary imaging Data, and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of all patients. According to the clinical classification criteria, 208 patients were divided into light group and ordinary group, and the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the two groups were compared.<bold>Results: </bold>Among 208 patients in this study, with a median age of 50.5 years (IQR,36-64.7,range,10-91 years), among which 107 (51.4%) were males and 101 (48.6%) were females. 51 (24.5%) had a clear exposure to COVID-19 infection within 2 weeks before admission, and 40 (19.2%) had a history of residence or exposure in Wuhan within 2 weeks before admission. Among all the patients, there were 16 (7.7%) with pulmonary diseases, 41 (19.7%) with hypertension, 11 (5.3%) with coronary heart disease, 13 (6.3%) with diabetes, 12(5.8%) with a history of alcohol consumption, and 12(5.8%) with a history of smoking. Among all clinical symptoms, 146 cases (70.2%) of fever, the highest temperature range was 37.3℃-41℃ before admission, 115 (55.3%) cases of cough, and 57 (27.4%) cases of chest tightness, 47 (22.6%) cases of fatigue, 28 (13.5%) cases of inappetence, 9 (4.3%) cases of diarrhea, 7 (3.4%) cases of nasal congestion or runny nose , and 5 ( 2.4%) cases of pharyngalgia. Analysis of the laboratory results of 208 patients showed that 42 (20.2%) cases had decreased white blood cell count, and 61 (29.3%) cases had decreased lymphocyte count. There were 154 (74%) cases with elevated CRP, 50 (24%) cases with elevated fasting blood glucose, and 23 (11.1%) cases with elevated LDH (&gt;245U/L). The comparison of clinical characteristics between the light group and the common group showed that the median age of the light group was 44.8 years (IQR 30-58), the median age of the common group was 53.1 years (IQR 38.8-67) (P&lt;0.01). The symptoms of fever [53(80.3%) vs 93(65.5%),P&lt;0.05], fatigue [53(80.3%) vs 93(65.5%),P&lt;0.05] and inappetence [4(6.1%) vs 24(16.9%),P&lt;0.05] in the light group were less than those in the common group. The white blood cell count (5.48 vs 6.37, P&lt;0.05), lymphocyte count (1.40 vs 1.61, P&lt;0.05) and HDL-C (1.5 vs 1.3, P&lt;0.05) of the common group were lower than that of the light group, while CRP (26.5 vs 22.1, P&lt;0.01), AST (22.9 vs 18.5, P&lt;0.05), fasting blood glucose (5.8 vs 5.6, P&lt;0.05), LDH (196.8 vs 157.9, P&lt;0.001) of the common group were higher than that of the light group.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>COVID-19 infection is mainly in middle-aged and elderly patients, patients with other diseases are more susceptible to infection. The main symptoms of COVID-19 infection were fever, cough, chest tightness, fatigue, and inappetence. Decreased lymphocyte count, increased CRP concentration, increased LDH concentration and decreased HDL-C concentration were the laboratory features of COVID-19 infection, and were important indicators to assess the severity of COVID-19 disease.

            Purpose To study the clinical characteristics, laboratory examination, radiological changes and treatments of 6 patients with severe SARS-Cov-2 infected pneumonia in Zunyi City, China.MethodsThe clinical data, laboratory examination, radiological changes and clinical treatment process of 6 patients with severe SARS-Cov-2 infected pneumonia admitted to the Department of Critical Medicine of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University were retrospectively analyzed.Results Four of the six patients were older than 65 years. Two patients had a history of exposure to Wuhan, and four patients had family clustering infection. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were dry cough (4, 66%) and fever (4, 66%). Laboratory tests showed that white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10, and urea nitrogen elevated. The Total lymphocyte count and T lymphocyte count decreased. All patients received antiviral therapy, blood purification, immunomodulatory therapy, and Chinese herb treatments. One patient was discharged from the hospital, and 5 patients' condition improved significantly. ConclusionT lymphocyte decreased significantly, IL-6 and IL-10 elevated in severe SARS-Cov-2 infected pneumonia patients. Elderly patients with comorbidities appear to be more severe and to recover more slowly. Blood purification can be tried for severe and critically ill patients. Early identification and timely treatment of critical cases is of crucial importance.

            Importance: Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outside Wuhan are not well described, and there is no risk stratification tool for the prediction of COVID-19 outcome.Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside Wuhan and to develop a risk stratification tool for early risk stratification.Design, Setting, and Participants: Single center, retrospective observational study conducted at Wenzhou, Zhejiang province (January 2020-February 2020) that included 140 patients with confirmed COVID-19. Clinical characteristics were described. A multivariate regression model was built to predict the risk of length of stay in hospital &gt; 20 days (ProLOS). The last patient visit was on February 23, 2020.Interventions: NoneMain Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was ProLOS. Other outcomes included conversion to negative nucleic acid test, date of hospital discharge, vital status at discharge.Results: A total of 140 patients were included during the study period. Lower lymphocyte count (1.0 [0.7, 1.3] vs. 1.3 [0.9, 1.72] × 109/𝐿; p = 0.008), lower ionized sodium (136 [134.6, 137.83] vs. 138 [135.28, 140.03] mmol/L; p &lt; 0.001) and higher PaCO2 (40.82 ± 3.96 vs. 38.48 ± 5.48 mmHg; p = 0.007) were associated with higher risk of ProLOS. The median time from hospital admission to the first negative nucleic acid test was 13 days (7.25 to 17 days). There were 4 (3%) critically and 5 (4%) severely ill patients. A multivariate model included predictors of age, time from contact to confirmation, DBP, lymphocyte count, AST, ionized sodium, PaCO2 showed good calibration and discrimination with an AUC of 81.6% (95% CI: 74.4% to 88.8%).Conclusions and Relevance: The study described clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside Wuhan. The major difference of COVID-19 in other cities included low comorbidity burden, low prevalence of severe or critical cases and low mortality rate. The risk stratification tool can be used for medical decision making and resource allocation.Authors Yucai Hong and Jianping Huang contributed equally to this work and are co-first authors.

Patients with cancer might be susceptible to the viral infection because of the immunosuppressive state cause by therapies on tumors. <bold>Case presentation:</bold> We present the clinical features of four cancer patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the past month in our hospital. One patient with uncontrolled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia and many other underlying diseases was killed by the virus, and the other three patients survived. Nearly all patients showed a decrease in lymphocytes including total CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells after infection of the virus. <bold>Conclusion: </bold>This report suggests that the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients is challenged by the immunosuppressive state of these patients under chemotherapy or surgery.

        <p>
            <bold>Background:</bold> Since December, 2019, the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China, has caused outbreak in China with more than 70,000 people infected and more than 2,000 people dead. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in non-Wuhan areas of Hubei province have not been described.
<bold>Methods :</bold> We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment progress of 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Central Hospital.
<bold>Results:</bold> Of the 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 30 (33.0%) cases were severe and two (2.2%) patients died. The severe patients tended to be older (50.5 vs 42.0, P=0.049), and have more chronic disease (40% vs 14.75%, P=0.009), compared to mild group. Only 67.0% of the patients were quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) positive on their first tests, while typical chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained for each patient. The most common complaints were cough (75, 82.4%), fever (59, 64.8%), fatigue (35, 38.5%), and diarrhea (14, 15.4%). Injuries outside the respiratory tract were identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (18, 19.8%), creatinine (5, 5.5%) and creatine kinase (14, 15.4%) in laboratory tests. In sum, 28 (30.8%) cases suffered injuries outside the respiratory system, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients.
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou is lower than that of Wuhan. Importantly, we discovered liver, kidney, digestive tract and heart injury in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems. Combining Chest CT images with qPCR of throat swab samples would improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnose.

        <p>
            Background/Objective To date, the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported mainly based on cases in Wuhan. We aimed to report the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infections outside Wuhan. Methods We analyzed 325 SARS-COV-2 infection patients hospitalized in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were compared between severe and non-severe cases. Results Of 325 patients, the median age was 51 years, 167 (51.4%) were men, and 107 (32.9%) had underlying diseases. 159 (48.9%) visited Wuhan or had contacted with people from Wuhan, but 57 (17.5%) had no clear epidemiological history. Compared with non-severe patients (n=299, 92%), severe patients (n=26, 8%) were older, had more common underlying disorder, more common lymphopenia, and higher D-dimer, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, procalcitonin, C-reactive-protein, and troponin I level. The common complications included secondary infection (12.3%), acute cardiac injury (9.2%), ARDS (5.5%), acute kidney injury (5.8%), and shock (4.9%). To Mar 12, 311 (95.7%) patients were discharged, 3 (0.9%) died, and 11 (3.4%) still hospitalized. Conclusions The severity rate and fatality rate were low if the measures (early isolation, early diagnosis and early management) were undertaken at the early time of the outbreak.

            Background In December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reported from Wuhan, China. Information on the clinical progress and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described. We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, and Xi-shui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical data were collected. Clinical progress of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. Results A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical progression of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia and radiological multilobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury or adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome , refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. Conclusions A period of 7–13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in COVID-19 progression. Age and male gender were independent risk factors for death of COVID-19.

            Background：The emergence of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 is a major public health issue, causing to a large global outbreak. However, the information regarding the clinical characteristic and progression of severe and critically ill patients with COVID-19 is scarce.Methods: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study and enrolled 126 severe and critically ill adult patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tongji hospital, between Feb 1 and Feb 20, 2020.Results: Of 126 patients, 85 patients with the positive of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included. The mean age of 85 patients was 68.3 (SD 10.5) years. More than half were men, 55 (62.4%) had chronic illness. 57 (66.3%) patients had died before Feb 28, 2020. the median duration from onset of illness to death, hospitalization to death and ICU admission to death were 22 (17.0-26.0) days, 9.0 (6.0-13.0) days and 5.0 (2.0-6.0) days, respectively. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were more likely old (69.6 [SD 10.22] vs 65.6 [10.9]). Furthermore, the non-survivors had higher white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lower lymphocyte and platelet count, lymphocyte percentage and albumin. Notably, arbidol may improve the survival of severe and critically ill patients.Conclusions: Our study reveals the non-survivors had worse blood routine and other clinical monitors. Additionally, arbidol may play useful role in the survival of severe and critically ill patients, which needs further validation.

        <p>
            Background

Until now, information on the clinical characteristics of severe and critical patients with COVID-19 is extremely limited.The aim of the present study was to analyse the clinical features of these patients and influencing factors of clinical outcome, and explore treatment effects of prone position on COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed on 55 COVID-19 patients in the ICU of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 6 to February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Case data from each patient were collected and related clinical outcomes on day 14 of ICU admission were recorded. The follow-up deadline was February 29, 2020.

Results

Of the 55 patients included, 35 were male (63.6%), with an average age of 63.0 (SD 15.2) years, and 80.0% were patients over 50 years old. The first three symptoms were fever (36 cases, 65.5%), fatigue (13 cases, 23.6%), and cough (11 cases, 20.0%). The rate of invasive mechanical ventilation was 52.7% (29 cases); on the 14th day of ICU admission, 31 patients(56.4%) were improved, and 19 (34.5%) were worsened.  On the 14th day after entering the ICU, a comparative analysis showed that peripheral blood CD4, CD8, and NK cell counts in deteriorated patients were significantly lower than those in improved patients (P&lt;0.05). Meanwhile, concentrations of IL-10, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-α in deteriorated patients were higher than those in improved patients (P &lt;0.05). Among  a total of 27 prone position sessions, the oxygenation index (PaO2 / FiO2 ) of 9 prone position sessions(33.3%) improved, and the PaCO2 in arterial blood gas analysis of 5 sessions(18.5%) improved.

Conclusion

The majority of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 in the ICU were over 50 years old and male. 52.7% need invasive mechanical ventilation. On the 14th day of admission, 56.4% of the patients improved, 34.5% of the patients deteriorated. The rate of deaths during hospitalization was 21.8%. The worsening of COVID-19 patients might be related to excessive inflammatory and immune responses. In addition, prone ventilation may improve oxygenation in some COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS, but a significant mortality benefit with proning was uncertain.

Their median age was 62 (range, 29-92) [IQR,49.5-69.0] years, 68% were male, and 28 (56%) patients had comorbidities, the most common being hypertension. In this cohort, 20(40%) patients survived ,16(32%) patients died, and the rest remained hospitalized. The invasive mechanical ventilator was used in 36(72%) patients with 15(30%) of them requiring prone positioning, and 17(34%) switched to ECMO. The compliance scores of lungs (Cstat)on the day of ICU admission among survivors were higher than those in non-survivors [42.0(18.0-47.0), vs. 19.5(14.0-24.2), p=0.038].The blood IL-6 levels and neutrophils counts at the first day of ICU admission were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors [123.7(85.3-228.8), vs. 20.2(6.8-67.2) ng/ml, p=0.025 for IL-6, and 20.2(6.8-67.2) vs. 4.01(1.99-7.05) × 10⁹/L, p=0.02 for neutrophils counts].The heart rates, PaCO2, lung injury scale (LIS), and positive end-expiratory pressure levels were constantly higher for 10 days in non-survivors than those who survived (p&lt;0.05).

            Backgrounds: The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been listed as a public health emergency of international concern by WHO. Most COVID-19 patients presented with a mild infection, but many challenges exist in therapy of severe and critical severe patients. This paper systematically reviewed clinical features, treatments and outcomes of severe and critical severe patients infected COVID-19. Methods: The clinical, laboratory, imaging features, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 were collected. The data were analyzed by using STATA 15 statistical software to estimate the prevalence and 95% CI in severe and critical severe patients with COVID-19. A random or fixed effect model was used to estimate the prevalence and 95% CI. Results: After screening, 8 studies including a total of 275 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The percentage of severe and critical severe patients in confirmed COVID-19 cases was 25% (95% CI 16-36%). Fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia and bilateral distribution of patchy shadows were the most prevalent findings in these patients. Utilization rate of antiviral drugs, corticosteroid, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation was high in therapy strategies. The most prevalent complications were ARDS, shock, and acute cardiac injury. Discussion: Severe and critical severe COVID-19 patients usually had complications even a fatal outcome.

            Background Since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, the disease has been found in many countries. Considering the lack of effective drugs and rapid spread of COVID-19, we did a clinical detailed retrospective analysis of 70 discharged patients which can help us to better determine the clinical features of the disease. Method We collected demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and chest computed tomographic (CT) data from patients’ hospital records, the time period were from hospitalization day1 to day7 and hospitalization last day. The retrospective study totally included 70 COVID-19 patients. Results The median age was 43 (IQR: 34-56) years. 41 (58.6%) patients were female, and there were 33 (47.1%) patients who were hospitalized more than 14 days. 18 (25.7%) patients were residents of Wuhan or recently travelled to Wuhan, 38 (54.3%) patients were having a close contact with the COVID-19 patients. The most common pre-existing diseases were liver disease (15.7%), hypertension (12.9%), renal disease (8.6), lung disease (5.7%). The time from illness onset to hospitalization was 4 (IQR: 2-7) days. The most common treatment regimen was Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV) + Interferon alpha inhalation (IAI) + Arbidol. Compared with hospitalization day1, White blood cell count, C-reacting protein, Potassium, Aspartate aminotransferase, Lactate dehydrogenase, and Lactic acid were significantly different than hospitalization day-last. The median number of times a patients receiving chest computed tomography (CT) from day1 to day7 was 3 (IQR: 3-4). The typical chest computed tomographic images were patchy shadows and ground glass opacity. Conclusion Currently, there are no specific antiviral therapies for COVID-19. 70 COVID-19 patients in our study responded positively to treatment during the two-week period. For those discharged patients with abnormal results, more attention is needed in the future studies to control the transmission.

            Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and differences in etiology, clinical manifestations, and psychological activity of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) among patients. Results We recruited 90 subjects, 30 were healthy controls, 30 were patients with moderate infection, and 30 were patients with severe/critical infections. No significant differences were noted in the sex ratio, mean age, body mass index, or blood type; however, the history of exposure of the patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls was noteworthy. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as well as the levels of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (SAA) were all increased. In terms of mental health, there were significant differences in the worry scores between severely and moderately infected patients and healthy controls. There was a significant difference in depression scores between patients with moderate infection and healthy hypertension, and there was also a significant difference in dream worry scores. Analysis of the Mini-Mental State Examination scores showed that for patients with moderate infection, the depression score was moderately and positively correlated with the dream anxiety score. For patients with severe infection, the anxiety score was positively correlated with the dream anxiety score, and the depression score was moderately and positively correlated with the dream anxiety score. Conclusion Patients with severe infection showed increased pain and sputum in the pharyngeal area compared with patients with moderate infection. Patients with blood type A may be more susceptible to COVID-19, and lymphopenia may indicate worsening of COVID-19.

            Background As the COVID-19 epidemic is unfolding, an infodemic has also developed. With commonplace social media usage, a massive amount of information and misinformation is spreading at the same time. Irrational responses are reported worldwide – face mask and detergent shortages, panic shopping, and xenophobia, which could possibly be a result of ineffective science communication. Using Macau SAR for a case study, this article sets out to understand effective prevention communication. Methods An observation study was conducted to understand Macau’s prevention communication in the COVID-19 epidemic. Results Macau has imposed a wide range of preventions, covering most dimensions of daily life. Lessons are learned in risk perception, language used, science communication, digital literacy, information flow, and support in STEM advancement. Conclusions Macau’s prevention communication is not perfect, but Macau’s experience offers insights to European authorities on how to contain the epidemic and minimize undesirable outcomes as the epidemic is just beginning in Europe.

The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of children and adult patients with 2019-nCoV infection and to explore the possible causes for the discrepant aspects.<bold>Methods: </bold>In this retrospective study, the medical records of 32 cases confirmed with 2019-nCoV ARD from Xi'an eighth hospital (Shaanxi, China) from January 31 to February 16, 2020 were reviewed.<bold>Results:</bold> In all 32 patients contained 7 children and 25 adults. All children were family cluster. For adult patients, local residents of Wuhan, recently travelled to Wuhan, patient contacted with people from Wuhan were 14 (56%), 10 (40%), 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adult was 5 days (range, 3 to 12) and 4 days (range, 2 to 12), respectively. Altogether 10 (40%) adult patients had underlying conditions significantly, but no children had. Fever (Children 71.4% vs. Adult 96%) and cough (Children 71.4% vs. Adult 76%) were the most common symptoms in both groups. The third symptom observed in children was diarrhea and/or vomiting (57.1%), for adult it was myalgia or fatigue (52%). On admission, 5 (71.4%) children patients showed pneumonia roughly the same as adult patients (20, 80%), and that the two group shared a multitude of common imaging characteristics. 20% of adult with leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was significantly more frequently in children (28.6%, P=0.014). More children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs. 4%, P=0.004). All patients were discharged after symptomatic treatment, including oxygen therapy, antiviral treatment, antibiotic treatment. Only one infant was intravenously injected low-dose glucocorticoids.<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results multi-dimensionally demonstrate that children with 2019-nCoV infection present a clinical picture which is often distinct from that of adults. Knowledge of these differences will be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) and for a future discussion on age specific infection case definitions.

        <p>
            <bold>Background</bold>: Currently, there is no available study about the occurrence of enterocolitis associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among adults.  <bold>Case presentation</bold>: A 56-year-old man had lower abdominal pain, distension, diarrhea, and bloody stool. Moreover, the patient presented with fever and general fatigue. Laboratory examination did not reveal leukocytosis nor neutrophilia. However, the patient’s C-reactive protein level increased to 4.9 (normal range: 0.0–0.3) mg/dL. Both sputum and stool cultures had normal results. However, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed wall thickness mainly in the submucosal layer of the left part of the large intestine. Thus, real-time polymerase chain reaction test of throat swabs was performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and positive results were obtained. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: We report the first case of enterocolitis correlated to COVID-19, and the patient had positive abdominal CT scan findings. This imaging modality could be effective for the diagnosis of enterocolitis associated with COVID-19.

        <p>
            Background Chest computed tomography (CT) has been accepted to provide reference for the diagnose and assessment the severity of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Decrease in the counts of lymphocyte and leukocyte is used as the diagnostic indicator of suspected COVID-19 cases. However, there is few study on exploring the hysteresis of chest CT changes and the predictive role of lymphocyte count in peripheral blood before treatment in the severity of the disease. Methods A retrospective analysis was carried out focusing on the data of patients tested to be positive for RNA nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs in 4 hospitals. An independent assessment was performed by one clinician using the DEXIN FACT Workstation Analysis System, and the assessment results were reviewed by another clinician. Furthermore, the mean hysteresis time was calculated according to the median time from progression to the most serious situation to improvement of chest CT in patients after fever relief. The optimal scaling regression analysis was performed by including variables with statistical significance in univariate analysis. In addition, a multivariate regression model was established to investigate the relationship of the percentage of lesion/total lung volume with lymphocyte and other variables. Results In the included 166 patients with COVID-19, the average value of the most serious percentage of lesion/total lung volume was 6.62, of which 90 patients with fever had an average hysteresis time of 4.5 days after symptom relief, with a similar trend observed in those without fever. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymphocyte count in peripheral blood and transcutaneous oxygen saturation decreased with the increase of the percentage of lesion/total lung volume. Meanwhile, age, fever and C-reactive protein exhibited no such effect in the established model. Conclusions There is a hysteresis effect in the improvement of chest CT image in relative to fever relief in patients with COVID-19. Besides, the percentage of lesion/total lung volume of chest CT correlates negatively with lymphocyte count in peripheral blood and transcutaneous oxygen saturation. Findings in our study may contribute to understanding the disease status of patients with COVID-19 and grasping the opportunity of treatment by clinicians.

        <p>
            <bold>Background:</bold> In late December, 2019, patients of atypical pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Subsequently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Feb 12, 2020, more than 44,000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed in China and continue to expand. Provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China have launched first-level response to major public health emergencies one after another from Jan 23.2020, which means restricting movement of people among provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP) cases and to depict the effect of restricting population movement. <bold>Methods:</bold> Excel 2010 was used to demonstrate the temporal distribution at the day level and SPSS 23.0 was used to analyze the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed NCP cases. <bold>Results:</bold> Since January 23, 2020, Wuhan migration scale index has dropped significantly and since January 26, 2020, Hubei province migration scale index has dropped significantly. New confirmed NCP cases per day in China except Wuhan gradually increased since January 24, 2020, and showed a downward trend from February 6, 2020. New confirmed NCP cases per day in China except Hubei province gradually increased since January 24, 2020, and maintained at a high level from January 24, 2020 to February 4, 2020, then showed a downward trend. Wuhan emigration scale index from January 9 to January 22, January 10 to January 23 and January 11 to January 24 was correlated with the number of new confirmed NCP cases per day in China except Wuhan from January 22 to February 4. Hubei province emigration scale index from January 10 to January 23 and January 11 to January 24 was correlated with the number of new confirmed NCP cases per day in China except Hubei province from January 22 to February 4.<bold>Conclusions:</bold> People who left Wuhan from January 9 to January 22 may lead to the outbreak in China except Wuhan and people who left Hubei province from January 10 to January 24 may lead to the outbreak in China except Hubei province. “Wuhan lockdown” and Hubei province launching first-level response to major public health emergencies may have had a good effect the control NCP epidemic. Because there were still new confirmed NCP cases in China except Wuhan and in China except Hubei province and this may indicate that the occurrence of second-generation cases.

            Purpose      To describe the correlation between the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings with hospitalization days in Coronavirus Infected Disease-19 (COVID-19) discharged patients. Method In this multicenter study, we retrospectively identified 153 discharged patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from Jan 16, 2020 to Feb 26, 2020 in Hunan province. Patients were grouped based on the hospitalization days: Group 1 (hospitalization days≦12 days) and Group 2((hospitalization days&gt; 12days). Demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings on admission and the imaging features of the first Chest CT on admission were analyzed. The differences between groups were analyzed using univariate logistic regression to find the impact factors. Results The cohort included 153 discharged patients (85 males and 68 females, with the mean age of 42.32±14.03 years old). 90(58.8%) patients had hospitalization days≦12 and 63(41.2%) patients had hospitalization days&gt;12. 44(48.9%) patients in Group1 and 28(44.4%) in Group 2 had been to Wuhan. In both Group1 and Group2, most common symptoms at onset were fever (62.2%, 60.3%) and cough (33.3%, 50.8%). Cough was occurred more common in Group 2(50.8%) than Group 1(33.3%) with a significant difference (p=0.03). 6(6.7%) patients in Group1 and 10(15.9%) in Group2 had admitting diagnosis as non-pneumonia (p=0.07), some of them occurred mild pneumonia during hospital stay. White blood cell (2.2%, 9.5%) and neutrophil (9.5%) count above normal were more common on in Group 2 (p=0.04, p=0.04). Patients in Group 2 had higher concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (P=0.04) than Group 1. Most of patients had multiple lesions (75.6%, 69.8%) with bilateral distribution (73.3%, 58.7%) in both groups. Mixed ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation appearance were seen in most patients. GGO components &gt; consolidation appearance were more common in Group 1(31.1%) than in Group 2(8.0%) with a significant difference between groups (P&lt;0.01). Patients had cough at onset disease (OR, 0.47; 95%CI, 0.23 to 0.96, p=0.04) and CT represented as GGO components more than consolidation (OR, 4.84; 95%CI, 1.80 to 13.04, p&lt;0.01) were associated with hospitalization days. Conclusions COVID-19 non-pneumonia patients with longer hospitalization days might have the persistent symptoms or pneumonia occurrence after admission. Chest CT could help prompt diagnosis and monitor disease progression, GGO/consolidation &gt;1 in mixed lesions was associated with shorter hospitalization days. Special attention should be paid to the role of radiological features in monitoring disease prognosis.

        <p>
            Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus recently isolated from humans. SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be the pathogen responsible for a cluster of pneumonia associated with severe respiratory disease occurred in December 2019 in China. This novel pulmonary infection, formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly in China and beyond. On 8 March 2020, the number of Italians with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 7375 with a 48% hospitalization rate. At present, chest computed tomography imaging is considered the most effective method for detection of lung abnormalities in early-stage disease and for quantitative assessment of severity and progression of COVID-19 infection.

        <p>
            Background: The lay public's behavioral responses during a virus spread, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), play an important role in bringing the outbreak under control, and provide insights into development of risk communication messages to the public. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the association between knowledge about COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, emotional reactions and precautionary behavior among the Israeli lay public at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,407 participants, aged 18+. Participants completed measures of knowledge about COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, emotional reactions, precautionary behavior , and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multiple hierarchical regression was calculated with precautionary behavior as the dependent variable. Results: Findings indicated that precautionary behavior was higher for females, older participants, participants with higher levels of knowledge about COVID-19, and participants with greater negative emotional reactions. A negative curvilinear relationship was found between perceived susceptibility and precautionary behavior, so that the latter was highest for participants with moderate perceived susceptibility. All interaction terms were non-significant. Conclusions: Findings suggest that in order to enhance precautionary behavior in the initial stage of a virus outbreak, it is recommended to pay attention to the public’s knowledge about the virus, perceived susceptibility and emotional reactions. Although negative feelings about the virus may motivate preventive behavior, it is important to address these feelings.

        <p>
            When everyone focuses on 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Hubei province, the epidemic in other province cannot be ignored, which also has an impact on the epidemic in the whole country. The most distinctive epidemic characteristic in all regions except Wuhan is that the most of confirmed cases are imported cases from Wuhan, and the propagation chain is relatively clear. Based on detailed contact tracing information of confirmed cases, combined with first-order outbreak response measures, we establish a disease transmission dynamical model to describe the infection propagation chain among the human population. Using Shanxi province as a case, modeling results indicate that the epidemic peak in Shanxi province occurred in February 2. In addition, our model suggests that according to the current development trend, COVID-19 will disappear in February with the final epidemic number of approximately 175 cases. It is verified that the most effective outbreak control measures in Shanxi include home isolation of people, surveillance and isolation of second-generation cases, contact tracing and management of contacts. With the end of the holiday, if the average number of contacts per person per day is less than 6 , it has little impact on the incidence of COVID-19, and even if third- and fourth-generation cases occur, the epidemic will be under control, no later than late March with a finial outbreak size of 220 cases. However, if the average number of contacts per person per day is greater than 6, the number of COVID-19 cases will continue to be reported resulting in another epidemic peak. Through the forecast and evaluation of COVID-19 in Shanxi, it is verified that the model with infection generations is more accurate to describe the spread mode and can be extended to regions with imported cases.

        <p>
            Coronaviruses have been circulating between animals and humans repeatedly. A novel human coronavirus, named COVID-19, has recently emerged in Hubei Province, China. Within the first two months, more than 2200 deaths have been confirmed, and there have been more than 79,000 hospitalized patients, mainly in China. Understanding the virus mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. In this study, the COVID-19 corona viral spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The cyclic peptide Pep42 (CTVALPGGYVRVC) was reported earlier to be the docking platform of GRP78 in cancer cells. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature (the S-S bond), have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues (region IV) of the spike can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.

            <bold>Objectives: </bold>To evaluate imaging features and performed quantitative analysis for mild novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) cases ready for discharge.<bold>Methods:</bold> CT images of 125 patients (16-67 years, 63 males) recovering from COVID-19 were examined. We defined the double-negative period (DNp) as the period between the sampling days of two consecutive negative RT-PCR and three days thereafter. Lesion demonstrations and distributions on CT in DNp (CT<sub>DN</sub>) were evaluated by radiologists and artificial intelligence (AI) software. Major lesion transformations and the involvement range for patients with follow-up CT were analyzed.<bold>Results:</bold> Twenty (16.0%) patients exhibited normal CT<sub>DN</sub>; abnormal CT<sub>DN</sub> for 105 indicated ground-glass opacity (GGO) (99/125, 79.2%) and fibrosis (56/125, 44.8%) as the most frequent CT findings. Bilateral-lung involvement with mixed or random distribution was most common for GGO on CT<sub>DN</sub>. Fibrous lesions often affected both lungs, tending to distribute on the subpleura. Follow-up CT showed lesion improvement manifesting as GGO thinning (40/40, 100%), fibrosis reduction (17/26, 65.4%), and consolidation fading (9/11, 81.8%), with or without range reduction. AI analysis showed the highest proportions for right lower lobe involvement (volume, 12.01±35.87cm<sup>3</sup>; percentage; 1.45±4.58%) and CT-value ranging –570 to –470 HU (volume, 2.93±7.04cm<sup>3</sup>; percentage, 5.28±6.47%). Among cases with follow-up CT, most of lung lobes and CT-value ranges displayed a significant reduction after DNp.<bold>Conclusions:</bold> The main CT imaging manifestations were GGO and fibrosis in DNp, which weakened with or without volume reduction. AI analysis results were consistent with imaging features and changes, possibly serving as an objective indicator for disease monitoring and discharge.

            Objective: we aimed to describe the chest CT findings in sixty-seven patientsinfected by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Method and material: We retrospectively reviewed 67 patients hospitalized in Ruian People's Hospital. All the patients received the positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The CT and clinical data were collected between January, 23 and February, 10, 2020. The CT images were analyzed by the radiologists.Conclusion: There are 54 patients with positive CT findings and 13 patients with negative CT findings. The common CT findings in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were ground glass opacities (42/54), lesions located in the peripheral area (50/54), multiple lesions(46/54), and lesions located in the lower lobes (42/54). There were some less common CT findings: air bronchogram (n=18), pleural thickening or pleural effusion (14/54), consolidation (12/54), lesions in the upper lobes (12/54), interlobular septal thickening (11/54), reversed halo sign (9/54), single lesion (8/54), cavitaties (4/54), bronchial wall thickening (3/54), intrathoracic lymph node enlargement (2/54).

        <p>
            <bold>Background:</bold> Since the first case of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Southwest China. The aim of this study was to describe the imaging manifestations of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in southwest China. <bold>Methods:</bold> In this retrospective study, data were collected from 131 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 3 Chinese hospitals. Their common clinical manifestations, as well as characteristics and evolvement features of chest CT images, were analyzed. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 100 (76%) patients had a history of close contact with people living in Wuhan , Hubei. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 included cough, fever. Most of the lesions identified in chest CT images were multiple lesions of bilateral lungs, lesions were more localized in the peripheral lung, 109 (83%) patients had more than two lobes involved, 20 (15%) patients presented with patchy ground glass opacities, patchy ground glass opacities and consolidation of lesions co-existing in 61 (47%) cases. Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19, that can quickly change over a short period of time.

        <p>
            <bold>Background:</bold> In December 2019, a cluster of patients associated with a seafood wholesale market was confirmed having infected the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China. As of Feb 11, 2020, 43144 cases of the 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed in the world, and person-to-person transmission has been recognized. To our knowledge, there are no reports regarding the 2019-nCoV pneumonia infected by cluster transmission within a family. The amount of close contact suspect was increasing. We reported cases of family cluster transmission of the 2019-nCoV infection, showing the differences in computed tomography (CT) manifestations and symptoms between patients with and without history of exposure to the epidemic area (Wuhan).<bold>Case Presentation:</bold> A 48-year-old man was presented to the hospital in Jan 30, 2020 with a 2-day history of low fever and chill. He had traveled to Wuhan City of Hubei Province of China 12 days before, and was confirmed having the 2019-nCoV infection based on his positive CT manifestations, clinical signs, and real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction results. The other three members of his family without history of exposure to the epidemic area (Wuhan) were subsequently identified having the 2019-nCoV transmissive infection based on the positive findings of real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction, but they did not have abnormal CT manifestations and clinical signs.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>For patients who have history of exposure to the epidemic area (Wuhan), the 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia can be identified by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction testing and chest CT together with the symptoms. But for patients without exposure to the epidemic area, the 2019-nCoV infection can be confirmed by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction testing and history of close contact with confirmed patients who have history of exposure to the epidemic area.

            <bold>Background:</bold> While 2019-nCoV nucleic acid swab tests has high false positives rate, How to diagnose 2019-nCoV pneumonia and predict prognosis by CT is very important.
<bold>Methods:</bold> In this retrospective single-center study, we consecutively included suspected 2019-nCoV pneumonia critical cases in the intensive care unit of Wuhan third hospital from January 31, 2020 to February 16, 2020. The cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, and all patients were evaluated with CT, cutoff values were obtained according to the Yoden index, and were divided into high CT score group and low CT score group. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected.
<bold>Results:</bold> The major imaging feature of 2019-nCoV pneumonia is the ground glass opacity (GGO). Multivariate regression analysis found that CT score and absolute count of lymphocytes were independent risk factor for death, and CT score predicted mortality AUC-ROC =0.7, cutoff=1.45. When the absolute count of lymphocytes decreased, the patient's CT also deteriorated.
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> CT score and absolute count of lymphocytes were independent risk factor for death, and patients with high CT score may have a worse prognosis. Lower absolute count of lymphocytes may indicated the patient's CT also deteriorated.

We aim to assess the use of D-dimer as a biomarker for disease severity and clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients.<bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of 248 consecutive cases of COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China from Jan 28 to Mar 08, 2020. Correlations of D-dimer upon admission with clinical staging, radiological staging, and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristics curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff level for D-dimer that discriminated those survivors versus non-survivors during hospitalization. <bold>Results:</bold> D-dimer elevation (≥0.50mg/L) was seen in 74.6% (185/248) of the patients. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis were ruled out in patients with high probability of thrombosis. D-dimer levels significantly increased with increasing severity of COVID-19 as determined by clinical staging (Kendall's tau_b = 0.374, P=0.000) and chest CT staging (Kendall's tau_b = 0.378, P=0.000). In-hospital mortality rate was 6.9%. Median D-dimer level in non-survivors (n=17) was significantly higher than in survivors (n=231) [6.21 (3.79-16.01) mg/L versus 1.02 (0.47-2.66) mg/L, P=0.000]. D-dimer level of &gt;2.14 mg/L predicted in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 71.3% (AUC 0.85; 95% CI=0.77-0.92).<bold>Conclusions:</bold> D-dimer is commonly elevated in patients with COVID-19. D-dimer levels correlate with disease severity and is a reliable prognostic marker for in-hospital mortality in patients admitted for COVID-19.

        <p>
            Background The outbreak and the rampant spread of SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, China, has infected thousands of patients and killed more than two thousand. We aimed to find indicators that could predict the progression of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods Medical history, clinical features, laboratory and radiological results were retrospectively reviewed from 112 patients with clinically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Jan 31, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 9, 2020. Results Based on their outcomes, we divided these patients into groups of remission, deterioration and death respectively, and analyzed the counts of lymphocyte and its subsets. A decreased combination of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts was observed as the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia progressed. Among them, the CD4+ T lymphocyte counts were reduced at the early stage, while CD8+ counts were decreased at advanced stage or end stage. Conclusions We identified in our study of 112 hospitalized patients that CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were useful markers to predict the clinical progression of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at different stages. Considering the large number of patients with severe pneumonia, and the urgency of this ongoing global public health emergency, the counts of lymphocyte and its subsets from laboratory examinations could be easy and useful indicators for physicians to determine a timely and proper therapeutic strategy for patients and an early warning sign for predicting or reducing mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia.

        <p>
            A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak from Wuhan, China has, as of February 13, 2020, infected nearly 60,000 people in China with the death toll passing 1300. The virus is also spreading worldwide rapidly, with 490 confirmed cases in 24 countries and 1 death at current stage. Numerous studies have recently been published in terms of genome structure, transmission, infection mechanism, and drug development of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this study, we performed a descriptive study by focusing on the first 63 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Xuzhou, a major city and a transportation hub with 10.44 million population (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2019) on the east coast of China. Among the 63 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the median age is 45-year-old and 49.21% are male. 23 cases (36.51%) are imported. 23 cases (36.51%) were confirmed between from January 26 to 31 while 40 cases (63.49%) from February 1 to 10. The mean period from isolation to confirmation is 4.95 days. Among the ten administrative divisions of Xuzhou city, Suining county (n=17) and Pizhou City (n=15) have the most cases while Tongshan district has none. A representative familial cluster was analysed in detail in order to get a better understanding of the transmission routes of the virus. Clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 in 41 confirmed cases were analysed, which could provide a meaningful understanding during the initial screening of the disease. In sum, this study provides an epidemiological overview of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Xuzhou, the economic hub of Huaihai Economic Zone (HEZ) and an important transportation center in China. Considering the ongoing situation of this newly emerged infection both domestically and internationally, more efforts should be required to reduce the transmission of the virus so as to avoid further casualties, economic losses, and global pandemic.Authors Liang Wang, Jiawei Yan, and Zhanzhong Liu contributed equally to this study.

            Background

Confronting with the outbreak of COVID-19, this cross-sectional study aimed to assess the differences of psychological status of temporomandibular disorders patients, orthodontic patients and the general population in China during the epidemic.

Methods

An online anonymous questionnaire was developed in Chinese, including the individual background information, the perception of the epidemic, and level of anxiety and depression through Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). The respondents were divided into Control group, ORTHO group and TMD group. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression modelling were performed.

Results

1241 valid questionnaires in total were collected, with 587 orthodontic patients and 220 TMD patients. The mean score of K10 was 18.65. When compared with the general population, TMD patients displayed statistically higher level of anxiety and depression (P&lt;0.05), whereas orthodontic patients not (P&gt;0.05). Multiple linear regression model also showed that age, gender, some concerns about the impact of epidemic were correlated with psychological status.

Conclusions

The overall mental health was severely worsened by the COVID-19 epidemic. TMD patients had higher level of psychological distress than orthodontic patients and the general population. Factors such as younger age, female, concerning about the isolation and psychological barriers and distrust were amongst the associations with a high level of psychological distress. Mental health care should be paid to patients when hospitals and clinics re-open after the COVID-19 epidemic, especially to patients with these relevant characteristics.

            <bold>Background:</bold> Corona virus infective disease 19 (COVID-19) is the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and spreads very rapidly, which become a worldwide public healthy crisis. Until now, there is no effective antivirus drugs or vaccines specifically used for its treatment. So it is urgent to discover efficient therapeutic methods. The same as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also invades organism by combining with Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Recently, there are reports about SARS-CoV-2 infected host not only through the respiratory tract, but also gastrointestinal tract. However, it is proved that ACE2 plays a key role in protecting subjects from lung injury and resisting the inflammation caused by intestinal epithelial damage. Interestingly, the expression of ACE2 protein is reduced after SARS-CoV infection. <bold>Methods:</bold> According to the dataset of genes co-expressed with ACE2 in the colonic epithelial cells, we established a protein-protein interaction (PPI) Network and selected hub genes from them. The cluster analysis was performed to find out the dense region of the PPI Network. Then, gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed to explore the main function of genes co-expressed with ACE2. Finally, we predicted the potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the connectivity map (Cmap) .<bold> Results:</bold> We constructed a PPI network containing 125 hub genes of genes co-expressed with ACE2 in the colonic epithelial cells and obtained two modules through cluster analysis. The GO analysis and the KEGG pathway revealed these genes were aggregated in ribosome, exosomes, extracellular cellular components; structure constituent of ribosome, G-protein coupled receptor activity, MHC class I and II receptor activity biological processes; immune response, protein metabolism, signal transduction biological processes; and ribosome, graft-versus-host disease, viral myocarditis pathways. The result from Cmap indicated ikarugamycin, molsidomine had highly correlated scores with the query files. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> We found out that ikarugamycin and molsidomine were the potential drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

        <p>
            Drug repositioning offers an unmatched opportunity to offer novel therapeutics to treat SARS family of coronaviruses (SARS-FCoVs); an issue that became extremely urgent with the spreading of a novel virus with potential to threaten the lives of millions of people. Hereby, we analyzed a dataset of patients who presented with SARS during the 2003 outbreak. We established a gene signature that defines differential gene expression in patients who were sick with SARS vs. healthy controls and convalescent patients. We used a robust platform to conduct drug repositioning based on clustered gene expression and pathway enrichment to identify best matching drugs. We identified 55 agents of potential benefit. In most of these drugs we were able to establish a link to previous related research, use as antiviral, or at least a hypothetical role in treating SARS-FCoVs. Most notably, the heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) emerged as a major component that enables viruses to hijack infected cells through the process of autophagy. Almost half of the drugs identified could be linked to hsp90. As such, we propose using hsp90 inhibitors, mainly geldanamycin and its derivatives, to treat COVID-19.

        <p>
            Background Lymphopenia is associated with COVID-19 severity. Herein we describe the dynamic changes in lymphocyte count during hospitalization and explore a possible association with the severity of COVID-19.Methods In this retrospective study, 13 non-severe COVID-19 patients diagnosed at admission were enrolled. One patient progressed to severe disease. Dynamic changes in lymphocyte count and CT score of all patients were analyzed.Results Lymphocyte count changed significantly in the non-severe patients over time (admission vs day 5, P=0.685; day 5 vs day 15, P&lt;0.001). Lymphocyte count of the severe patient fluctuated, and even decreased within the first 12 days post-admission, before increasing gradually. Chest CT scores of nine (75%) non-severe patients on the 5th day of hospitalization were higher than at admission, but decreased gradually thereafter (admission vs day 5, P&lt;0.001, day 5 vs day 15, P=0.004). In the severe patient, CT score continued to increase for 2 weeks after admission, before decreasing gradually.Conclusions Non-severe COVID-19 patients had significantly increased lymphocyte count and decreased CT score 1 week after illness onset. Dynamic change in lymphocyte count in the early stages of COVID-19 may be helpful to identify the patients who are more likely to develop severe or critical illness.

        <p>
            <bold>Background: </bold>To assess the dynamic changes in clinical and CT characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different epidemiology histories.<bold>Methods: </bold>Fifty-three discharged COVID-19 patients were enrolled at Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, from Jan 21 to Mar 10, 2020. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between CT scores and laboratory indicators. Patients were divided into Wuhan (lived in/or traveled to Wuhan, 30 cases) and nonWuhan group (close contacts or unknown exposure, 23 cases). The CT and laboratory findings were compared between and within groups during the clinical process.<bold>Results: </bold>Fever (88.7%), cough (64.2%), fatigue (34%), and abnormal laboratory indicators, including lymphopenia, reduced albumin, albumin/globulin (A/G), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), were mainly observed. Subpleural ground-glass opacities (86.8%) were usually detected at admission. The CT scores were highly correlated with lymphocytes, CRP, albumin, and A/G at initial and follow-ups (all <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Four days after admission, most patients (66.7% Wuhan, 47.8% nonWuhan) showed progression, and the CT scores of Wuhan significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>=0.015). Eight days after admission, the vast majority of patients (69.2% Wuhan, 100% nonWuhan<italic>, p</italic>=0.006) presented improvement, and the CT scores of nonWuhan were significantly lower than Wuhan (<italic>p</italic>=0.006). Pneumonia was completely absorbed in most patients 2-4 weeks after discharge.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>CT plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and monitoring changes in COVID-19. Lymphocytes, CRP, albumin, and A/G are expected to predict disease severity and prognosis. Viral pathogenicity in non-endemic areas may be weaker than core-infected areas. Lung lesions can disappear around 4 weeks after discharge in most patients.

        <p>
            <bold>Background:</bold> Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which originated in Wuhan, China, and spreading over the country including Jiangsu Province. Our study aimed to study the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and therapies of these severe cases in Jiangsu Province.<bold>Methods:</bold> A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to extract and analyze epidemiological, clinical, laboratory data and treatment of 60 severe cases with COVID-19 infection from 12 large hospitals in Jiangsu Province between Jan 24 and Feb 23, 2020. Cases were identified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The improvement and deterioration subgroups were compared to identify predictors of disease progression. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 23, 2020.<bold>Results:</bold> A total of 631 infected cases with COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province, 60 of which were severe cases. Up until Feb 23, 2020, the mortality rate of these severe patients was 0%. The median age was 57 years (range, 26 to 97), and 58.3% were man. The body mass index (BMI) of these patients was higher, with an average of 25 kg/m². More than 90 percent of the patients had a history of contact with an infected patient or dined together, and two patients were infected while staying in the same train compartment with a confirmed patient. 51.7% of severe cases had at least one underlying disease, and low fever (80.0%) and dry cough (51.7%) were the most common symptoms. Mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score on admission was 14±5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) appeared in 15% of the patients. White blood cell counts decreased in 45.0% of patients, lymphopenia in 63.3%, thrombocytopenia in 13.3%, and procalcitonin levels in 88.3% of the patients were less than 0.5 ng/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in immunoglobulin therapy and glucocorticoids therapy between the improvement and deterioration subgroups (P&gt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis indentified higher levels of troponin T (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.08; P=0.04), antiviral therapy with interferon (OR: 6.33; 95% CI: 1.18-33.98; P=0.03), and the application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.99; 95%CI: 1.17-3.41; P=0.01) as predictors of disease progression, whereas higher lymphocyte count (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.02-0.57; P=0.01) and early prone ventilation were associated with improvement (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01-0.98; P=0.04).<bold>Conclusions:</bold> The COVID-19 infection had a low mortality rate in Jiangsu Province, China. The higher levels of troponin T and lower lymphocyte count were predictors of disease progression. Antiviral therapy with interferon was not recommended. The early prone ventilation may be an effective treatment for severe cases.

        <p>
            A mathematical model is proposed to assess the effects of a vaccine on thetime evolution of a coronavirus outbreak. The model has the basic structure of SIRIcompartments (susceptible-infectious-recovered-infectious) and is implemented by tak-ing into account of the behavioral changes of individuals in response to the availableinformation on the status of the disease in the community. We found that the cumu-lative incidence may be significantly reduced when the information coverage is highenough and/or the information delay is short, especially when the reinfection rate ishigh enough to sustain the presence of the disease in the community. This analysis is in-spired by the ongoing outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirusCOVID–19.

        <p>
            Background The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia is very serious, and no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed. The fresh drug research and development cycle is too long to meet clinical emergency needs, and ""old drugs and brand new applications"" have a huge therapeutic potential. During our previous treatment, we found that the lopinavir/ritonavir treatment recommended in the Fifth edition of the treatment plan had little effect. Earlier studies have shown that chloroquine can inhibit coronavirus replication through multiple mechanisms. Our previous use of chloroquine to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2(novel coronavirus)-infected pneumonia has a higher negative rate of nucleic acid in throat swabs within 5 days after administration than that using lopinavir/ritonavir. However, the half-life and side effects of chloroquine vary greatly among individuals. Methods/design We plan to conduct a prospective, open-label, multicenter randomized controlled, comprehensive treatment clinical study. The study consisted of three phases: a screening period of 1-110 days, a treatment period of no more than 28 days, and a follow-up period of 1 month. Participants will be assessed at baseline and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 21, and 28 after the intervention begins. In this study, chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir tablets were used to treat patients with eligible novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed at various centers between February 12, 2020 and May 31, 2020. The efficacy and safety of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir are to be evaluated. At the same time, explore the correlation between patient genetic polymorphisms and chloroquine steady-state concentration, therapeutic effects and adverse reactions in the body. It is an anti-virus for pneumonitis caused by novel coronavirus. The optimization and update of the antiviral treatment plan provides evidence-based evidence.

            The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is threatening public health security in China. Owing to the severity of this epidemic, identifying a proper treatment for COVID-19 is crucial. Although the Quing-Fei-Pai-Du (QFPD) decoction preliminary displayed promising clinical efficacy, its potential biological mechanism has not been explored for further pharmaceutical development and treatment. Through systems pharmacology and virtual screening approaches, we explored the potential mechanism of action and the active ingredients of the QFPD decoction for COVID-19 treatment. A ingredients-targets dataset was generated. ADME/Tox and molecular docking analyses were conducted to screen the potentially-active ingredients. Protein-protein interaction network and the detection algorithm were applied to dynamically identify functionally-relevant protein groupings. Totally, 705 ingredients and 1,489 targets were obtained. Docking revealed that 40 components could be promising active ingredients, 6 of which (Neohesperidin, Naringenin, Liquiritigenin, Apigenin, Isoquercitrin and Herbacetin), were highlighted according to the comprehensive analysis. The enrichment analysis of the highlighted ingredients showed that several significant pathways could be highly related to their mechanisms of action, such as response to oxygen levels, response to oxidative stress, and blood circulation. Overall, our findings suggest the promising effects of the QFPD decoction for COVID-19 treatment. Further experimental and clinical verifications are needed.Authors Xiting Wang and Meng Liu contributed equally to this work.

            Background The 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, Hubei in December 2019. Beside from Hubei Province, no large-scale epidemiological data are available. The purpose of the study is to investigate the epidemiology of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Shandong province, China. Methods Data were obtained from the Epidemic Daily Report Network. Confirmed patients and suspected cases in Shandong were included in the analysis. Data including age, sex, address, time of disease onset, time of diagnosis, and sources of transmission were collected. Results By February 13 th , 2020, 518 patients in Shandong province were formally confirmed with COVID-19 with an additional 78 suspected. Most of the confirmed patients were young or middle-aged (mean: 42.6 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 1.26:1. Among the 596 patients, 29.2% had a history of traveling in Hubei within 14 days. There were 99 cluster outbreaks and 5.23 cases were transmitted by one cluster outbreak. Among the confirmed patients, 17 patients (3.3%) had critical pneumonia, 36 (6.9%) had severe pneumonia and no deaths reported. Conclusions Considering the collective confirmed and suspected cases of SARS-Cov-2 in Shandong by February 13 th , 2020, males and the young and middle-aged populations were more frequently affected by the virus, which was most commonly transmitted through cluster outbreaks. Since the initial case of SARS-Cov-2 was identified, the onset-diagnosis delay was reduced with time.

        <p>
            Background Porcine viral diarrhea can cause great damage to the pig industry and high mortality to piglets. Furthermore, multiple pathogen infections and synergistic infections commonly existed in clinic. This has resulted in great difficulties in determining the main pathogenic factors, which would delay the prevention and control of diseases. Methods A total of 518 porcine stool specimens were collected from 9 pig herds in Shanghai, China from 2015 to 2017 and used for pathogen detection. A Luminex xTAG multiplex detection method was developed for the detection of 11 viral diarrhea pathogens, which allows for the simultaneous qualitative and quantitative detection of viral diarrhea pathogens in clinical samples. Results The minimum detection rate of the Luminex xTAG multiplex detection method was at least 10 times higher than the traditional PCR method. As a result, 209 (40.3%) were positive for porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), 138 (26.6%) for porcine astrovirus (PAstV), 91 (17.6%) for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), 78 (15.1%) for porcine sapelovirus (PSV), 68 (13.1%) for porcine sapovirus (PoSaV), 27 (5.2%) for porcine teschovirus (PTV), 25 (4.8%) for porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), 17 (3.3%) for porcine rotavirus (PoRV), 16 (3.1%) for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), 10 (1.9%) for porcine torovirus (PToV), and 9 (1.7%) for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), respectively. Furthermore, multiple infection rate of diarrhea sample was 17.57% for dual-infection, 11.58%for triple-infection, 4.63% for quadruple-infection, 0.77% for quintuple-infection, 0.58% for sextuple-infection and septuple-infection, respectively. Infection pattern of the viral diarrheal pathogens was changing, and different farm had the various diarrhea infection patterns, which proved the great importance of epidemiological surveillance and the guidance effect to clinical production. PoSaV, PoRV, PAstV, PToV and PEDV were indicated as the predominant viruses of clinical samples collected in 2017 by the quantitative analysis. Conclusions Here we provide a Luminex xTAG multiple detection method for viral diarrhea pathogen infection in clinical,which was more sensitive and specific than general multiplex PCR method. Furthermore, the surveillance confirmed the complicated infection status in China, which demonstrated the need for continuous surveillance and provided data for the prevention and control of viral diarrhea.

            <bold>Background: </bold>Since December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread quickly and thumped many countries and regions. The epidemic of central China was under the spotlight and attracted much more attentions. However, there are few reports describing COVID-19 patients in the regions outside of Wuhan, which are undergoing the change from sporadic imported cases to community-acquired transmission.<bold>Methods: </bold>The electronic medical records of 74 laboratory-confirmed patients of COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Their epidemiological, demographic, clinical and radiological characteristics were systematically summarized. The difference between severe patients and non-severe patients were also analyzed statistically.<bold>Results: </bold>The 74 COVID-19 patients were composed of 4 (5.4%) mild patients, 56 (75.7%) common patients, 13 (17.6%) severe patients and 1 (1.4%) critical patient. 43 were male, and 31 were female, with the average age 48.1±17.5. No significant difference of susceptibility was observed between genders, and almost people with all age were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Before Jan 26, only imported sporadic cases were observed. However, from that day onward, family cluster infection cases increased dramatically, up to 70.3% (52/74), which were mainly from 15 family. The incubation period spanned from 0 to 19 days, with the median 5, and 81.4% had symptom onset within 7 days. At admission, 31.1% of patients had underlying diseases and the most common underlying diseases were hypertension (13.5%) and diabetes (5.4%). The most common symptoms were fever (90.5%), cough (75.7%), fatigue (36.5%) and chest distress (32.4%). 36.5% and 16.2% of patients had leukopenia and lymphocytopenia. 43.2% of patients had increased C reactive protein (CRP), and 40.5% had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and 21.6% had higher calcitonin. 74.3% of patients had obvious lesions in both lung lobes and 56.8% of lesions manifested as ground glass opacity. Compared with non-severe group, the severe/critical group were significantly older and had more underlying diseases. After treatment, all patients improved and were discharged. No medical professional infection and death case were reported.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The epidemic of COVID-19 in Nanjing were mainly caused by family cluster infection. The entire prevalence and illness were much milder than those of Wuhan. The disease of COVID-19 could be controlled and cured.

        <p>
            Objective: Numerous cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the world in succession. We reported the epidemiological and clinical features of 478 confirmed cases from a multicentre study outside of Wuhan, China. Methods : We collected patients who were transferred by Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals in four major cities including Beijing, Chongqing, Jinan and Nanning in China. We compared the characteristics between imported and indigenous cases, and calculated the fatality, and the rate of severe cases, mild and asymptomatic cases to generate the pyramid of COVID-19 infection. Results : The mean age of patients was 46.9 years old and 49.8% were male. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (69.7% ), cough (47.5%), fatigue (24.5%), dyspnea (8.4%) and headache (7.9%). In the study, most cases (313, 65.5%) were indigenous, while 165 (34.5%) were imported. During the early stage, the imported cases were dominant, which declined from Feb 1, when the indigenous cases rise sharply. Compared with the indigenous cases, the imported cases were significantly distinct concerning gender composition (P=0.002), classification of severity (P=0.006). Conclusions : On the basis of this study, we suggest that preventing import from outside and controlling spread inside should be a basic principle for resisting COVID-19 infection. If not, the region or area will face chaos.

        <p>
            Background In December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. With the advent of the Chinese Spring Festival, this disease spread rapidly throughout the country. The information about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan is limited. Methods All of the patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha City, the designated hospital for COVID-19 assigned by the Changsha City Government. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, data of laboratory, radiological picture, treatment, and outcomes records of 201 COVID-19 patients were collected using electronic medical records. Results This study population consisted of 201 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha by February 15, 2020. The median age of the patients was 45 years (IQR 34–59). About half (50.7%) of the patients were male, and most of the infected patients were staff (96 [47.8%]). Concerning the epidemiologic history, the number of patients linked to Wuhan was 92 (45.8%). The most common symptoms were fever (125 [62.2%]), dry cough (118 [58.7%]), fatigue (65 [32.3%]), and pharyngalgia (31 [15.4%]). One hundred and forty-four (71.6%) enrolled patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Fifty-four (26.9%) patients showed unilateral involvement, and three (1.5%) patients showed no abnormal signs or symptoms. The laboratory findings differed significantly between the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU groups. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had depressed white blood cell (WBC), neutrocytes, lymphocytes, and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Moreover, higher plasma levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), creatinine (CREA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected in the ICU group. Conclusions In this single-center study of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, 22.4% of patients were admitted to ICU. Based on our findings, we propose that the risk of cellular immune deficiency, hepatic injury, and kidney injury should be monitored. Previous reports focused on the clinical features of patients from Wuhan, China. With the global epidemic of COVID-19, we should pay more attention to the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan.

        <p>
            The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is getting worse every day all over the world. The present study aimed to review the epidemiological characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Shenzhen city, a super megacity of China, to provide some references for fighting to the coronavirus. We collected data of 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 of Shenzhen through March 7<sup>th</sup>, 2020. The epidemiological characteristics of the patients were analyzed. Besides, we collected the governmental measures of Shenzhen city, and the the dynamic changes of the epidemic outbreak. Governmental strategies such as early detection, early hospitalization and popular science <italic>etc. </italic>are effective for the prevention and control of the epidemic. Nearly 80% confirmed patients with COVID-19 in Shenzhen were in normal or mild conditions, and the mortality was less than 1%. Age, gender, exposure to source of transmission within 14 days and basic diseases are major risk factors for severe patients. Patients in characters of elder, male, with exposure of Wuhan and carried basic diseases had higher risk to be in severe condition (P&lt;0.01; P&lt;0.001). There were 368 patients discharged from hospital by the end of March 7<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Patients in severe conditions took more time from onset to discharge (P&lt;0.001), so as those elder one (P&lt;0.001) or who carried basic diseases (P&lt;0.01). The differences of epidemiological characteristics between children and the elderly are still not clear. The nucleic acid test of some discharged patients returned to positive again, and the potential mechanisms need to be further explored. In conclusion, timely administrative intervention is necessary for prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients in characters of elder, male and carried basic diseases worthy more attention. The management of discharged patients, especially the investigation of the recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA will be the focus on for the next step.

            Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the leading cause of a public health emergency in the world, accompanying with high mortality in severe corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19 ), thereby early detection and stopping the progress to severe COVID-19 is important. Our aim is to establish a clinical nomogram model to calculate and predict the progress to severe COVID-19 timely and efficiently.Methods: In this study, 65 patients with COVID-19 had been included retrospectively in the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 17, to February 11, 2020. Patients were randomly assigned to train dataset (n=51 with 15 progressing to severe COVID-19) and test dataset (n=14 with 4 progressing to severe COVID-19). Lasso algorithm was applied to filter the most classification relevant clinical factors. Based on selected factors, logistic regression model was fit to predict the severe from mild/common. Meanwhile in nomogram sensitivity, specificity, AUC (Area under Curve), and calibration curve were depicted and calculated by R language, to evaluate the prediction performance to severe COVID-19.Results:High ratio of sever COVID-19 patients (26.5%) had been found in our retrospective study, and 84% of these cases progress to severe or critical after 5 days from their first clinical examination. In these 65 patients with COVID-19, 77 clinical characteristics in first examination were collected and analyzed, and 37 ones had been found different between non-severe and severe COVID-19. But when all these factors were analyzed in establishment of prediction model, six factors are crucial for predicting progress of severe COVID-19 via Lasso algorithm. Based on these six factors, including increased fibrinogen, hyponatremia, decreased PaO2,multiple lung lobes involved, down-regulated CD3（+）T-lymphocyte and fever, a logistic regression model was fit to discriminate severe and common COVID-19 patients. The sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 0.93, 0.86, 0.96 in the train dataset and 0.9, 1.0, 1.0 in test dataset respectively. Nomogram-predicted probability was more consistent with actual probability by R language.Conclusions:In summary, an efficient and reliable clinical nomogram model had been established, which indicate increased fibrinogen, hyponatremia, decreased PaO2, multiple lung lobes involved, down-regulated CD3（+）T-lymphocyte and fever at the first clinical examination, could predict progress of patients to severe COVID-19.

            As of February 13, 2020, there have been 59,863 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections in mainland China, including 1,367 deaths. A key public health priority during the emergence of a novel pathogen is estimating clinical severity. Here we estimated the symptomatic case-fatality risk (sCFR; the probability of dying from the infection after developing symptoms) of COVID-19 in Wuhan using public and published information. We estimated that sCFR was 0.5% (0.1%-1.3%), 0.5% (0.2%-1.1%) and 2.7% (1.5%-4.7%) for those aged 15-44, 45-64 and &gt;64 years. The overall sCFR among those aged ≥15 years was 1.4% (0.8%-2.0%).

        <p>
            There has been an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China since December 2019. Cases have been exported to other parts of China and many other countries. We provide estimates of the daily trend in the size of the epidemic in Wuhan based on detailed information of 10,940 confirmed cases outside Hubei province.
In this modelling study, we first estimate the epidemic size in Wuhan from January 11, 2020, to February 13, 2020, based on the confirmed cases outside Hubei province that left Wuhan by January 23, 2020. Since some confirmed cases have no information on whether they visited Wuhan before, we adjust for these missing values. We then calculate the reporting rate in Wuhan from January 20, 2020, to February 13, 2020. Finally, we estimate the date when the first patient was infected.
We estimate the number of cases that should be reported in Wuhan by January 11, 2020, is 4,094 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3,980 – 4,211) and 58,153 (95% CI: 56,532 – 59,811) by February 13, 2020. The reporting rate has grown rapidly from 1.41% (95% CI: 1.37% - 1.45%) on January 20, 2020, to 32.15% (95% CI: 31.26% - 33.07%) on February 11, 2020, and reaches 61.89% (95% CI: 60.17% - 63.66%) on February 13, 2020. The date of first infection is estimated as November 30, 2019.
The estimated reporting rate has increased rapidly to over 60% on February 13, 2020, mainly because the inclusion of 14,031 clinically diagnosed cases in the case reports of Wuhan. This might indicate that clinical diagnosis could be a good complement to the current method of confirmation. The currently reported number of 35,991 cases as of February 13, 2020, is still far below our estimate of 58,153. There may still be a lot of unreported cases. More thorough screening of all patients with a mild or moderate symptoms of respiratory diseases should be conducted to better control the spread of COVID-19.

        <p>
            <bold>Background</bold>: The emerging virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a large outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China since December 2019. As of February 15, there were 56 COVID-19 cases confirmed in Hong Kong since the first case with symptom onset on January 23, 2020.<bold>Methods</bold>: Based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission events, which occurred in Hong Kong, and had primary cases known, as of February 15, 2020. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit three different distributions, Gamma, Weibull and lognormal, that govern the SI of COVID-19. We select the distribution according to the Akaike information criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc).<bold>Findings</bold>: We found the Gamma distribution performed lightly better than the other two distributions. Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9−6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8−5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission events in Hong Kong.<bold>Conclusion</bold>: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are crucially needed in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.

        <p>
            <bold>Background:</bold> A novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China towards the end of 2019 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 virus). Large scale spread within China and internationally led the World Health Organisation to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30<sup>th</sup> January 2020. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death. There are no antivirals of proven clinical efficacy in coronavirus infections. Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue, has inhibitory effects on animal and human highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including highkly pathogenic MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, in in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. It is also inhibitory against COVID-19 virus in-vitro. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in adult patients with severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19 virus infection.<bold>Methods:</bold> The protocol is prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. Adults (≥18 years) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 virus infection, and severe pneumonia signs or symptoms, and radiologically confirmed severe pneumonia are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir or placebo for 10 days. The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at Day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 ꞊ discharged; 6 ꞊ death).

        <p>
            Background Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI), including the common cold, pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, tonsillitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia are the most common diagnoses in pediatric patients, and account for most antibiotic prescriptions. A confirmed and rapid ARTI diagnosis is key to preventing antibiotic abuse. Recently, based on different detection principles, many multi-target molecular analyses that can detect dozens of pathogens at the same time have been developed, greatly improving sensitivity and shortening turnaround time. In this work, we performed a head-to-head comparative study between melting curve analysis (MCA) and capillary electrophoresis assay (CE) in the detection of nine respiratory pathogens in sputum samples collected from hospitalized children with ARTI. Methods By MCA and CE analysis, nine common respiratory pathogens were tested in hospitalized children&lt; 13 years of age who met the ARTI criteria respectively. Results A total of 237 children with sputum specimens were tested. For all the targets combined, the positive detection rate of XYRes-MCA was significantly higher than that of ResP-CE (72.2% vs. 63.7%, p=.002). Some pathogens were detected more often with MCA, such as parainfluenza virus, influenza B and coronavirus, and some pathogens do the opposite, such as adenovirus and influenza A (all p&lt;.01). Very good kappa values for most of pathogens were observed, except for Influenza B and coronavirus (both κ=.39). Conclusions Multiplex melting curve and capillary electrophoresis assays performed similarly for the detection of common respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children, except for Influenza B and coronavirus. A higher sensitivity was observed in the melting curve assay. By using this sensitive and rapid test, it may be possible to achieve improved patient prognosis and antimicrobial management.

            Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in December 2019 and is spreading rapidly. Rapid and accurate identification of suspected cases is critical in suppressing viral spread. We aimed to highlight the discrepancies in the varying criteria used by international agencies and highly impacted individual countries worldwide.Methods: The criteria from two international agencies and ten countries across Asia, Europe, and North America were reviewed. Each included information on the clinical causes of illness and epidemiology risk factors. Non-English language guidelines were translated into English by one of the co-authors who was fluent in that language. Results: Although the majority of criteria are modified from the World Health Organization recommendations, the specific clinical features and epidemiological risks for triggering evaluation of COVID-19 in suspected patients differed widely among nations. The rationale for these differences may be linked to each individual country’s resources, politics, experience with previous outbreaks or pandemics, health insurance systems, severity of the COVID-19 situation, and other undetermined factors. Conclusion: There was no consensus on the single best criteria for identifying a suspected case of COVID-19.

        <p>
            Objective: To investigate the resilience of medical workers from other provinces to Wuhan to support fighting against 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods : In February 2020, medical works supporting Wuhan in the fighting against COVID-19 were eligible to complete an online survey made up of Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Results : A total of 114 medical workers were investigated. The CD-RISC scores of medical workers were at a high level (67.03±13.22). The resilience level was highest for physicians (73.48±11.49), followed by supporting staff, including health care assistants, technicians (67.78±12.43) and nurses (64.86±13.46). There were also significant differences in education, training and support from hospital, adequate preparation and confidence to complete support tasks (P&lt;0. 05). Resilience was negatively correlated with anxiety (r=-.498, P&lt;0.01) and depression (r=-.471, P&lt;0.01), but positively correlated with active coping styles (r=.733, P&lt;0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that active coping (β=1.314, p&lt;0.05), depression (β= -.806, p&lt;0.05), anxiety (β= -1.091, p&lt;0.05) and training and support from hospital (β= -3.510, p&lt;0.05) were significant influence factors of resilience. Conclusion : The manager of the health management system should be aware that active coping, depression, anxiety and training, and support from hospitals are the influential factor of resilience. In addition, it is necessary to need to take these preferences into account and develop psychosocial interventions to help reinforce the resilience of medical works fighting emerging contagious diseases such as COVID-19.

        <p>
            Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread across China and the world, since outbreak at the end of 2019. Although COVID-19 is generally considered as self-limiting, some of cases develop in to fatal respiratory restress, multiple organ failure and even sudden death. According to the data released by the provincial health commissions, there are obvious regional differences in COVID-19 mortality. To explore possible factors of COVID-19 related severity and mortality in laboratory-confirmed cases from Henan and Zhejiang.Methods: We collected the public data released by the government. We analyzed and compared the possible factors, including initial symptoms, gender, age, place of residence, time interval from onset to diagnosis, epidemiological history and the grade of hospital for patient’s treatment in laboratory-confirmed cases. Student’s t-test, Chi-square (2) test, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and Mann-Whitney U rank sum test were used complied with the applicable conditions. Statistical test was performed with a level of significance α=0.05.Results: Death cases in Henan were mainly from male, elderly infected persons and those who had a history of contact with patients and underlying basic diseases. Henan had the higher proportion of cases with fever and the lower proportion of asymptomatic infection, and had higher proportions of imported male cases with a contact history, and elderly cases living in rural areas, relative to Zhejiang. The time interval of confirmed cases in rural areas of Henan was 0.8 day longer than that in Zhejiang. Hospitals grade for patients’ treatment in Henan was lower than Zhejiang.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that initial symptoms, age, place of residence, gender, the time interval from onset to diagnosis and the grade of designated hospital for patient’s treatment are possible factors behind COVID-19 related severity or mortality. This study will provide useful information for public health authorities to develop disease prevention strategies.

        <p>
            Background: The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people in the World. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 30 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (43.0%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (27.3%), recovered or discharged (14.4%), deceased (11.4%), and hospitalized in intensive care (3.9%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 130,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic greater than 2 months. Conclusions: Once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.

        <p>
            Background: Due to the emergency pandemic threat, the COVID-19 has attracted widespread attention around the world. Common symptoms of infection were fever, cough, and myalgia fatigue. On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declares this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).Methods: In order to study the spread of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, this paper proposed an improved SEIR model to simulate the spread of the virus, which includes the effect factor of government intervention. The model parameters are determined based on the daily reported statistical data (up to February 8) of confirmed, suspected, cured, and death. According to utilize the spread rate, the probability of infection of the suspected, the probability of the suspected becoming a confirmed one, the cure rate, the mortality rate, and the quarantine ratio, we performed simulations and parameter calibrations at three region levels, i.e., China, Hubei and non-Hubei respectively. In addition, considering that the government initiated effective prevention and control measures after the outbreak, this paper dynamically estimates all the parameters of the proposed model.Results: The simulation reveals that the parameters of non-Hubei region are not significantly different from Hubei’s. Hubei Province has a high transmission rate, low cure rate, high probability of infection, low effective quarantine rate. since January 31, with the continuous strengthening of epidemic prevention and control measures, all parameters of the model have changed significantly. The parameters of Hubei and non-Hubei regions have the same trend. The trend of all parameters is now moving in a direction that is conducive to reducing the number of confirmed, suspected and fatal cases.Conclusions: The number of infections of the virus initially showed a rapid increase in the trend, and the number of infectious case showed a clear downward shape. With the government to take a variety of prevention and control measures and the efforts of the general medical staff, the number of infection curve on February 22 appeared in the top of the arc pattern, indicating that the inflection point began to appear, but the decline in the number of infections slowly.

        <p>
            Background

China has been severely affected by COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) since December, 2019. This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors.

Methods

Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regressions were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem.

Results

Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people ( P &lt;0.001). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality ( P &lt;0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (&lt; 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality.

Conclusions

Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.

        <p>
            From December 31, 2019, a large-scale 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in China. Tracking and analyzing the heterogeneity and effectiveness of cities’ prevention and control for COVID-19 epidemic is essential to design and adjust epidemic prevention and control. The number of newly infected cases in 25 China’s worst cities for COVID-19 epidemic from January 11 to February 10 was collected. The heterogeneity and effectiveness of these 25 cities’ prevention and control measures for COVID-19 were analyzed by using a estimate time-varying reproduction numbers method and a serial correlation method. The results shown that the effective reproduction number (R) in 25 cities showed a downward trend as a whole, but there was a significant difference in the R change trends among cities indicating that there was heterogeneity in the spread and control of COVID-19 in cities. Moreover, the COVID-19 control in 21 of 25 cities were effective and the risk of infection was decreasing due to their R had dropped below 1 on February 10, 2020 and the average decline of R in the past 5 days was greater than 0, while cities of Wuhan, Tianmen, Ezhou and Enshi were still difficult to effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic in a short period of time because their R was also greater than 1.

        <p>
            Viral diseases cause significant harm to human health and often cause high mortality. In the past twenty years, humanity has undergone infection by SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and COVID-19 coronaviruses, which spread from animals to humans and from person to person. These diseases have led to large economic losses. To fight coronaviruses and other viruses, it is proposed to use miRNAs, which regulate protein synthesis at the translational level. MirTarget program was used to determine the following binding characteristics: the locations of miRNA binding sites in the 3'UTR, 5'UTR, and CDS; the free energy interaction ∆G between miRNA and mRNA; the ΔG/ΔGm value, where ΔGm is equal to the free energy binding of miRNA with its full complementary nucleotide sequence; and the nucleotide interaction schemes between miRNAs and mRNAs. Out of 2565 miRNAs, miR-4778-3p, miR-6864-5p and miR-5197-3p were identified as the most effectively interacting with the gRNA of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19, respectively. Based on the miR-4778-3p, miR-6864-5p and miR-5197-3p sequences, complete complementary miRNA (cc-miR) binding sites in the gRNA coronaviruses were created. The detected binding sites of these cc-miRs did not form intramolecular complexes in the 2D structure of the gRNA of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 with a value of more than 85%. Therefore, the cc-miRs will bind gRNA at these sites without competition. The cc-miRs for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 did not have target genes among the 17508 human coding genes with a ΔG/ΔGm of more than 85%, which implies the absence of side effects of these cc-miRs on the translation of human mRNAs. cc-miRs can be used as therapeutic agents by incorporating them into exosomes or other vesicles and introducing them into the blood or lung by inhalation. The introduction of cc-miR into the blood will suppress the reproduction of the virus in the blood and in all organs into which it can enter. The proposed method of inhibiting the reproduction of coronaviruses can be used for other viruses.

Clinical variables were recorded including exposure history, clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. For each HRCT, pulmonary lesions including ground-glass opacification (GGO), consolidation, and evidence of fibrosis were recorded. The Student’s t test or Wilcoxon’s test was used for comparison between COVID-19 and common pneumonia. Spearman correlation was used to evaluate correlations between the pneumonia findings on CT and clinical variables.  <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 37 patients (M/F:19/18; 43.73±16.71 years) in COVID-19 group and 41(M/F:13/28; 49.77±15.00 years) in common pneumonia group were evaluated. Patients with COVID-19 demonstrated a typical pattern of bilateral, multi-lobal GGO, sometimes with consolidation and fibrosis, but a mild degree of pneumonia findings than the control group ( P = 0.0024). 23/37 (62.16%) patients with COVID-19 had a preferable subpleural distribution, while the patients with common pneumonia had higher frequency of peribronchovascular pattern (16/41, 39.02%, P =0.0046). The duration between the illness onset and CT were significantly correlated with the severity scores in both groups. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients with COVID-19 admitted out of Wuhan demonstrated a milder pulmonary change and a preferable subpleural pattern on HRCT when comparing with the patients with common pneumonia.

        <p>
            The causative agent of COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus which has been officially named SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the discovery of extremely low CG abundance in its open reading frames. We found that CG reduction in SARS-CoV-2 is achieved mainly through mutating C/G into A/T, and CG is the best target for mutation. In view of energy usage, a coronavirus with low CG abundance has higher efficiency in translating its RNA, because the secondary structure formed by viral genome is less stable. 5’-untranslated region of SARS-CoV-2 has much more CGs and is capable of recruiting host ribosomes to initiate translation. Notably, genomes of cellular organisms also have very low CG abundance, suggesting that mutating C/G into A/T occurs universally in all life forms. Moreover, CG is related to mutational hotspots and CpG islands in cellular organisms. The relationship between them is worthy of further investigations.

        <p>
            Recently, a new and fatal strain of coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2 (Disease: COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, China in December of 2019. Due to its fast growing human to human transmission and confirmed cases in nearly every country, it has been declared as pandemic by World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Till now, there is no therapy such as vaccines and specific therapeutic agents available globally. Inspite of this, some protease inhibitors and antiviral agents namely lopinavir, ritonavir, remdisivir and chloroquine are under investigation and also implemented in several countries as therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19. Seeing the health crisis across the world, it was our aim to find out a suitable drug candidate which could target SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, molecular docking of 7 proteinsof SARS-CoV-2 was done with 18active constituents that have previously been reported to be antiviral or anti-SARS-CoV agents. The docking results of these 18 compounds were compared with 2 FDA approved drugs that have are currently being used in COVID 19, namely Remdesivir and Chloroquine. Our result revealed that among all, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major constituent of green tea, is the lead compound that could fit well into the binding sites of docked proteins of SARS-CoV-2. EGCG showed very strong molecular interactions with binding energies -9.30, -8.66, -8.38, -7.57, -7.26, -6.99 and -4.90 kcal/mole for6y2e, 6vw1, 6vww, 6lxt,6vsb, 6lu7 and 6lvnproteins of SARS-CoV-2, respectively.Therefore, EGCG as per our results, should be explored as a drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19.

        <p>
            Objectives To retrospectively analyze the most common imaging features on CT at baseline and as they evolve with time as the disease progresses or resolves in a cohort of patients affected with 2019 coronal virus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in Zhuhai, China.Methods We evaluated 38 patients with COVID-19 in the authors’ institution from Jan 1 to Jan 31, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analyzed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 18, 2020. Results 38 initial scans and 62 follow-up scans were obtained. 28 (74%) patients had the history of travel to or residence in Hubei Province of China in 14 days prior to the illness onset. Common findings included ground-glass opacification (GGO), sometimes mixed with consolidation, and interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickening. Follow-up imaging often demonstrated peripheral GGO and consolidations spreading to the remainder of the lungs and the increasing consolidative component reflecting the progression of the disease. 8 patients (21%) whose swabs or serum were positive for COVID-19 had no imaging findings on CT throughout the disease course. After treatment the serum and sputum tests became negative for COVID-19 in 32(84%) cases. 28(74%) patients were discharged and three (8%) of them were transferred to the Observation Ward, while seven (18%) patients were kept in Isolation Ward. Conclusion The commonest pattern observed was GGO alone or GGO mixed with consolidation predominantly in lower and peripheral lungs. The follow-up CT scan is crucial for the diagnosis and evaluation of the disease process.

        <p>
            Background COVID-19 poses a great challenge to the global health system. The nurses of emergency and fever outpatient (EFO) act as gatekeepers to the health care system in the public health response to COVID-19 epidemic. This study examined the psychological impact of COVID-19 upon EFO nurses in Chinese hospitals. Methods In midmonth of February, 2020, convenience sampling was used to recruit EFO nurses from hospitals in Jiangsu Province. Data were obtained by self-administered online questionnaires, which consisted of a general questionnaire, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Perceived Stress Scale-14 and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. A total of 481 questionnaires were returned and 453 valid questionnaires were recovered. Multiple linear regression was used to explore the influence of socio-psychological and working condition factors on anxiety, stress and stress coping tendency. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the associations among anxiety, stress and coping tendency. Results Among the participants, 281(62.03%) had no anxiety symptoms, 154(34.00%) had mild anxiety, 16(3.53%) had moderate anxiety, and 2(0.44%) had severe anxiety. There were 146(32.23%) participants with scores greater than 25 in the PSS, indicating excessive stress. We found that 229(50.55%) participants were more likely to respond positively to stress, while 224(49.45%) were more likely to respond negatively. The models we used included gender, fear of infecting family members, regretting being a nurse, having children, confidence in fighting outbreak, rest time, professional attitudes, having attended infection prevention training, and number of night shifts; and they were all predictors of the mental health of EFO nurses. Pearson correlation showed a positive correlation of the anxiety with stress score (r=0.443, P&lt;0.001), while the coping tendency score was found negatively correlated with anxiety (r=-0.268, P&lt; 0.001) and stress (r=-0.503, P&lt; 0.001). Conclusion COVID-19 has a certain psychosocial impact upon EFO nurses. Effective measures, such as strengthening protection training, adequate nurses for emergency and fever clinics, reducing night shifts, and timely updates of latest epidemic situation, should be taken. Moreover, greater attention should be paid to female EFO nurses and nurses with children.

        <p>
            Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), since its emergence from Wuhan China in December 31, 2019 is still uncontrolled and has raised attention around the globe. According to World health organization, up to March 20, 2020, globally 209,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported along with 8778 deaths. 2019-nCoV is likely to be a recombinant of different coronaviruses such as SARS CoV and MERS CoV. Recent developments revealed that glycosylated spike (S) protein of 2019-nCov is contributing significantly in facilitating 2019- nCov infection in human body. The subunit (S1) of spike protein facilitates 2019-nCov binding with host cells’ receptors, while S2 subunit (post fusion core of 2019-nCov) is a key factor in fusion of 2019-nCov with host cell membrane and subsequent inoculation of its DNA in to the host cell. Therefore, in coronavirus infection, membrane fusion and receptor binding are critical. And if active sites of 2019-nCov spike protein S2 (post fusion core of 2019-nCov) are blocked, this may reduce COVID-19 infections in human. We use clustering based drug-drug interaction (DDI) networks and drug repositioning approach based on modularity to inhibit the membrane fusion and receptor binding capacity of 2019-nCov. About 150 drug compounds effective against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were retrieved, and screened on the basis of Lipinski rule of five. Clusters and strongly interacted DDI networks were generated in accordance to their modularity class, average path length and density. Promising drug candidates were then filtered by toxicity indicator and molecular docking. Our finding reveals that ZINC000029038525 and ZINC000029129064 drug compounds have significant binding potential with active sites of post fusion core of 2019-nCov ‘S2’ subunit and may inhibit membrane fusion and receptor binding capacity of 2019-nCov. Therefore, these drug compounds alone or in amalgamation could be strong and more effective therapeutic candidates against 2019-nCov infections.

            Novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV is a danger to the world and is spreading rapidly. Very little structural information about 2019-nCoV make this situation more difficult for drug designing. Benzylidenechromanones, naturally occurring oxygen heterocyclic compounds, having capability to inhibit various protein and receptors, have been designed here to block mutant variety of coronavirus main protease enzyme (CoV M<sup>pro</sup> ) isolated from 2019-nCoV with the assistance of molecular docking, bioinformatics and DFT. ( Z )-3-(4’-chlorobenzylidene)-thiochroman-4-one showed highest binding affinity to the protein. Binding of a compound to this protein actually inhibit the replication and transcription of the virus and ultimately, stop the virus multiplication. Incorporation of any functional groups to the basic benzylidenechromanones enhance their binding ability. Chloro and bromo substitution amplify the binding affinity. ADME studies of all these compounds indicates they are lipophilic, high gastro intestine absorbable and blood-brain barrier permeable. The outcome reveal that the investigated benzylidenechromanones can be examine in the case of 2019-nCoV as potent inhibitory drug of CoV M pro , for their strong inhibition ability, high reactivity, and effective pharmacological properties.

        <p>
            COVID-19 has globally spread and has become a new pandemic, but there is still no effective drugs or vaccines to treat or prevent this disease. SARS-Cov-2 invades human cells through its spike proteins interacting with human ACE2 receptors. One strategy to prevent the virus from entering cells is the interruption of the viral spike protein interacting with ACE2. In such an emergent situation, drug repurposing is a promising method for rapid drug development. Here, we selected around 15000 molecular candidates including FDA-approved drugs from DrugBank and natural compounds from TCMSP to perform virtual screening for potential molecules that can target viral spike protein based on its crystal structure. In this article, we present the top 20 molecules with high binding affinity with spike protein, of which, digitoxin, a cardiac glycoside in DrugBank and bisindigotin in TCMSP, extracted from <italic>indigo naturalis</italic> and <italic>polygoni tinctorii foliu</italic>, have the highest docking scores. In addition, we also found that raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor, has a relatively high binding score. Those molecules with high binding capacity to spike glycoprotein might be used by other researchers for further anti-COVID-19 drug development.

        <p>
            Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed tremendous challenges to the world's public health. The conditions of some patients can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Current studies suggest that an outbreak of inflammatory response known as cytokine storm may play a key role in the process. This study was performed to investigate the relativity of the production of circulating microparticles (cMPs) and the expression of inflammatory factors (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8 and IL-10) expression in the blood on the degree of COVID-19. Methods A total of 89 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were divided into four groups, namely, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill groups, according to China's COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Program (6th trial version), and 30 healthy persons were selected as the control group. The groups were compared in terms of cMP production and IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels in their blood, and the correlation between cMP production and the expression of inflammatory factors with the degree of COVID-19 were analysed. Results Differences in cMP production and IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 expression levels among the five groups were statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between cMP production or the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and the degree of COVID-19 (cMP, r=0.981; IL-6, r=0.954; IL-8, r=0.863; IL-10, r=0.895; P&lt;0.05). Conclusion Increased levels of cMP, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 aggravate COVID-19. cMP production and the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 may predict the degree of COVID-19 to a certain extent. The early inhibition of cMP overproduction and IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 expression may be an important therapeutic target for the prevention of COVID-19 progression.

            Background

Less aligned emphasis has been given to the COVID-19 infodemic coordinating with the COVID-19 outbreak. Global profusion of tangled monikers and hashtags has found their ways in daily communication and contributed to backlash against Chinese. Official naming efforts against infodemic should be meet with a fair share of identification. Based on brief critical reviews on previous multifarious naming practices, we punctuate heuristic introspection in scientific conventions and sociocultural paradigms. 

Methods

Infodemiological analysis promises to articulate that people around the globe are divided in their favor stigmatized monikers in the public and scientific communities because of perceptual bias. 

Results

There is no positive correlation between the degree of infection in their territories and collective perceptual bias against COVID-19. The official portfolio “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” has not become de facto standard usages, but full-fledged official names are excepted to duly contribute to the resilience of negative perceptual bias and collective behavioral propensities amid public panic.

Conclusions

As an integral component of preparedness, appropriate nomenclatures should be duly assigned to the newly identified coronavirus and caused respiratory tract disease in humans amid global public health crisis.

            On December 31st, 2019, the Chinese government announced officially that the country had a pneumonia case with an unknown cause. After that, Korea had 24 confirmed cases on February 8th, and the number has increased constantly since then. COVID-19, a highly contagious virus, infected another patient, Case No. 31, in Daegu; she was the first patient related to Sincheonji Church in Daegu. Later, the number of cases involved with Sincheonji skyrocketed. On March 6th, 2020, the accumulated number of confirmed cases was 6,284, with 42 dead among them. This study, through collecting epidemiological data about various COVID-19 infection cases, found out that getting together in large groups and religious ceremonies leads to massive infection, and that paying close attention to personal hygiene by wearing masks and sanitary gloves, etc., can prevent the spread of COVID-19. Additional epidemiological data and related studies on COVID-19 infections in Korea might either support or modify this conclusion. However, this study is significant in that it emphasizes the precautionary principle in preventing and managing infectious diseases, and that it has a suggestion for public health policies which are on urgent demand currently.

        <p>
            Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been firstly detected in China at the end of 2019 and it spread in few months all over the world. Italy is the second country in the World for number of cases, and the diffusion of COVID-19 has followed a peculiar spatial pattern. However, the interest of scientific community has been devoted almost exclusively to the prediction of the disease evolution over time so far. Methods: Official freely available data about the number of infected at the finest possible level of spatial areal aggregation (Italian provinces) are used to model the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level. An endemic-epidemic time-series mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the phenomenon. Results: Three subcomponents characterize the fitted model. The first describes the transmission of the illness within provinces; the second accounts for the transmission between nearby provinces; the third is related to the evolution of the disease over time. At the local level, the provinces first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, the component accounting for the spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent for provinces that are strongly involved by contagions. Moreover, the proposed model provides good forecasts of the number of infections at local level while controlling for delayed reporting. Conclusions: A strong evidence is found that strict control measures implemented in some provinces efficiently break contagions and limit the spread to nearby areas. While containment policies may potentially be more effective if planned considering the peculiarities of local territories, the effective and homogeneous enforcement of control measures at national level is needed to prevent the disease control being delayed or missed as a whole. This may also apply at international level where, as it is for the EU or the USA, the internal border checks among states have largely been abolished.

To overcome this barrier, we illuminate the chemical and biological mechanisms behind LCTE’s effects, by exploring the chemical compounds contained in LCTE ingredients, the proteins targeted by these compounds as well as undertaking the network pharmacology analysis. The results disclosed that LCTE contains compounds with the potential to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and inflammation, and that the compounds targeted proteins significantly related to the main symptoms seen in COVID-19. The general effect of LCTE was to affect the pathways involved in viral and other microbe infection, inflammation/cytokine response, and lung diseases.

        <p>
            The fundamental aim of the present study is to analyse and find the solution for the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the deadly and most dangerous virus from the lost three months called coronavirus. The mathematical model consisting of six nonlinear ordinary differential equations are exemplified and the corresponding solution is studied within the frame of 𝑞-homotopy analysis transform method (𝑞-HATM). Moreover, a newly defined fractional operator is employed in order to understand more effectively, known as Atangana-Baleanu (AB) operator. For the obtained results, the fixed point theorem is hired to present the exactness as well as uniqueness. For diverse arbitrary order, the behaviour of the outcomes is presented in terms of plots. Finally, the present study may help to examine the wild class of real-world models and also aid to predict their behaviour with respect to parameters considered in the models.

        <p>
            Recently a new coronavirus strain, COVID-19 has emerged in Wuhan City, China which cause disease and in many cases deaths to humans. Considering its severity a number of works are working on it and full genomic sequences has already released in the last few weeks to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Based on currently available genomic information a phylogenetic tree was constructed from four types of representative viral proteins (Spike, Membrane, Envelope and Nucleoproetin) of COVID-19, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HKU1, MERS-CoV, HKU4, HKU5 and BufCoV-HKU26 clearly demonstrated that the ancestral origin and distant evolutionary relation of newly epidemic novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It had been found that COVID-19 was evolutionary related to SARS-CoV. It was also found that COVID-19 proteins were almost more than ninety (90%) similar and identical with SARS-CoV proteins. The cross-checked conservancy analysis of COVID-19 antigenic epitopes showed significant conservancy with SARS-CoV proteins. VaxiJen server reveal almost 100% immunogenic potential of four viral proteins with COVID-19. In this article, we present an effort on molecular evolutionary analysis, temperature comparison and compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on the 2019 novel coronavirus based on the several open datasets on COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) and possible threat to Bangladesh.Authors Md Bashir Uddin and Mahmudul Hasan contributed equally to this work

        <p>
            BackgroundIn December 2019, a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness, novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Health care workers exposure to a high density of patients are at extremely high risk of becoming infected at the early outbreak of this disease for not realizing the fact of human-to-human transmission among close contacts at that time. The false-negative nasopharyngeal swabs of SARS-CoV-2 caused the delayed diagnosis of COVID-19. The nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in negative nasopharyngeal swabs cases were not reported previously. We wish to alert the potential transmission risk in COVID-19 patients with negative swab tests to the clinicians and stress the role of serological detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2.MethodsThis study evaluated a total of 6 cases and four of them were health care providers who worked in the same ward. All epidemiological and clinical information was collected. Respiratory samples of the patients were tested for influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA The reverse-transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was conducted and serological detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG/IgM is performed by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit.ResultsWe reported two related clusters of COVID-19 cases. The first cluster is a nosocomial infection of four health care providers at early January in one ward of university hospital. One of them made sequential familial cluster of infection. For total six cases, four of them (66.7%) showed negative RNA of SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients received either self-quarantined at home or were admitted to hospital for isolated treatment. All recovered and had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM positive (100%) for serological detection of SARS-CoV-2 at recovery stage.ConclusionsOur study provides a cautionary warning that negative results of nasopharyngeal swabs of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection can increase the risk of nosocomial infection among health care providers. Serologic detection for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM is an important test in the assistant diagnosis of COVID-19.

        <p>
            <bold>Background: </bold>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. As of mid-March 2020, more than a total of 150,000 cases have been reported in 122 countries, including 1,543 in the United Kingdom. Within London, there are five universities with medical schools each faced with difficult decisions on how to respond to this unprecedented situation, having to balance the education of future doctors who will soon be joining the front lines and their safety. In this paper, the responses and timeliness of medical schools are collated and compared. This will help guide medical schools’ responses in the future.<bold>Methods: </bold>Information was gathered from the official university websites and social media platforms. Thematic analysis was performed to obtain overarching categories of responses by the medical schools.<bold>Results: </bold>All five medical schools displayed similar responses to COVID-19, following guidance provided by Public Health England (PHE), Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Medical Schools Council (MSC). Eight broad themes of responses were identified to have been undertaken by most London medical schools. Responses such as suspending clinical placements, keeping university facilities open and not banning on-campus events were universally adopted by all five medical schools. Other responses such as specific exam rearrangements and elective travel advice were more heterogeneous amongst the medical schools.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Medical schools must take extraordinary measures in response to a pandemic. The experience gained from the COVID-19 pandemic will help future administrations be more confident in providing a more rapid response to similar health crises.

        <p>
            Current new COVID-19 viruses have already spread in multiple countries and have resulted in over one hundred thousand human infections and over three thousand human deaths worldwide. The possibility of a global pandemic is growing. It appears most of the infection resulted deaths are mainly due to dysfunctions or failures of the lung or multiple organs that could be attributed to host immune system’s hyperinflammatory disorders. In this work, a model is proposed to correlate the Pathogen Infection Recovery Probability (PIRP) versus Proinflammatory Anti-Pathogen Species (PIAPS) levels within a host unit, where a maximum PIRP is exhibited when the PIAPS levels are equal to or around PIAPS equilibrium levels at the pathogen elimination or clearance onset. Based on this model, rational or effective therapeutic strategies at right stages or timing, with right type of agents and right dosages, can be designed and implemented that are expected to effectively achieve maximum PIRP or reduce the mortality.

            A pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus with high nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses detected in horseshoe bats is spreading across the world and impacting the healthcare systems and global economy<sup>1,2</sup>. A suitable small animal model is urgently needed to support the development of vaccines and antiviral treatments against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 in the golden Syrian hamster model. The SARS-CoV-2 virus replicated in the epithelial cells of respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral antigens in the areas of lung consolidation on day 2 and 5 post- inoculation, followed by rapid viral clearance and tissue repairing on day 7. Viral antigen was also detected in the epithelial cells of duodenum without apparent inflammatory response on day 2. Notably, we observed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted efficiently from the inoculated hamsters to co-housed naïve contact hamsters. The inoculated hamsters and naturally-infected hamsters lost greater than 10% of the body weight, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies within 14 days. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden Syrian hamsters resemble features found in human patients with mild infections.Authors Sin Fun Sia, Li-Meng Yan, and Alex WH Chin contributed equally to this work.

        <p>
            Sudden, large-scale, and diffuse human migration can amplify localized outbreaks into pandemics. Rapid and accurate tracking of human population mobility using reliable mobile phone data could therefore be helpful for policy responses. Here, we examine mobile phone geolocation data for all 18,514,920 counts of individuals egressing or transiting through the prefecture of Wuhan, China, between January 1 and 24, 2020. First, we document the efficacy of quarantine measures in ceasing population movement.Second, we show that the distribution of population outflow from Wuhan accurately predicts the relative frequency of, and geographical distribution of, COVID-19 infections through February 12, 2020, across all of China, up to two weeks in advance. Third, we present a risk model that not only predicts confirmed cases, but also identifies high- transmission-risk locales at an early stage. Fourth, we develop a mobility-data-driven modeling framework to statistically derive the growth pattern of COVID-19 and its spread; this model can yield a benchmark trend and an index for assessing COVID-19 risk for different geographic locations (290 prefectures). Prefectures above the index’s 90% confidence interval are likely experiencing more local transmissions than imported cases; prefectures below the 90% confidence interval are controlling the spread of the virus more effectively (or, alternatively, are at greater risk of information inaccuracy). This approach can be used by policy makers in developing nations, which typically have mobile phone infrastructure but limited healthcare capabilities, to make rapid and accurate risk assessments ahead of second-wave outbreaks in order to overcome resource and logistics limitations.

            <bold>Background: </bold>The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease. Moreover, 14% of the discharged patients tested virus positive again. However, the underlying clinical mechanisms are still under investigation. <bold>Case presentation: </bold>The current study summarized the clinical course, radiological features and laboratory test results of two COVID-19 patients who tested positive again during the quarantine after hospital discharge. We found that while all symptoms were relieved, their lesions in lungs were not fully recovered, and both of them had slight coughs. In addition, when the lesions were further recovered and the cough symptoms were further remitted, they tested virus negative again. <bold>Conclusions: </bold>These results implied that the positive result is unlikely caused by the reinfection from others or the remained virus. Rather, it may derive from the remained virus transferred from the lower respiratory tract to the throat or nose with coughs.

        <p>
            Background The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak which was reported by World Health Organization (WHO) at 21th of January 2020 situation report spreads around the globe during next few weeks and causes serious health, social and financial issues. The primary epicentre was reported is Wuhan City, China and together with other affected regions in Asia remains the most monitored area. On the other hand, the European region was experiencing only a few cases until February 29th when the number of confirmed cases reached one thousand infections. Within a few days during the 8th of March the Italian most infected places were locked by restrictive quarantine. In this study we present probabilistic model to track the infection spread trough the European regions based on the model adjusted with worldwide data-sets. Methods To track and predict the officially reported number of cases we developed probabilistic model with the ability to predict the number of confirmed cases one day ahead. The model has internal/hidden parameters which cannot be directly observed such as the number of infectious individuals or transmissibility rate which is represented by reproduction number $R_t$. The model starts with assumed number of infectious individuals and reproduction number $R_0$ and as more data are gathered from data-sets during time the internal parameters are further estimated. The model is updated each day as the new number of confirmed cases are reported. Particle filters algorithm is used as the back-end method due to its ability to handle multi-modal data distribution. Results Presented results show the performance of the probabilistic model which is able to handle short-term prediction (in number of days) of confirmed and recovered cases. The estimated reproduction rate is further used in long-term simulation which fits the data gathered world-wide. The one day prediction error is below 5\% of nominal value and as we are located in Czechia the prediction model for our region was tested 4 days forward with the same error. The overal performance of the model was compared to data gathered from China due to the longer history of measurements. Conclusion We have proposed a probabilistic model which is used with particle filters to predict next moves of the confirmed cases. As a side effect we were able to model internal parameters as reproduction number or recovery rate which can be used for running long-term simulations of virus spreading.

            Background Since December 2019, more than 77,665 patients have been diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) in Wuhan, Hubei Province. According to previously published data, most of the critical and deceased patients are middle-aged and elderly patients with complications related to multiple chronic diseases. Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases. On January 29, The Lancet reported that 41 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV, and 8 patients were complicated with diabetes, accounting for 20% 1 . It has been suggested that diabetic patients are likely more susceptible to 2019-nCoV.At present, there is no effective treatment method or vaccine for NCIP. The prognosis of patients mainly depends on their immune system. However, diabetic patients with NCIP have higher requirements for treatment and nursing due to their complicated condition.To summarize the protective experience and provide a basis for hospital and patient care, we reviewed the protective mechanisms and effects in 12 diabetic patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China. Methods During nursing care, strict isolation and protection were emphasized, which included in-hospital isolation and protection, ward disinfection and isolation, ward environment layout, self-protection of medical staff, specimen collection and transportation; disease condition monitoring included blood glucose management, nutrition support, basic nursing, medication care, psychological support and discharge instructions. One patient died of complications due to gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and the other 11 patients were cured and discharged. Discussion Strict isolation, protection and disease monitoring are prerequisites for reducing complications and improving the cure rate of 2019-nCoV.

Purpose To quantify the chest CT scans of patients with CODIV-19 pneumonia using the pulmonary inflammation index (PII)and associate it with the severity of pneumonia. Methods A total of thirty inpatients admitted between January 30 and February 29, 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 infection were enrolled in this retrospective review. Patients were classified as “severe”(those who met the severe pneumonia criteria) or “mild”. Chest CT scans and clinical statistics data were obtained at four milestones (the date of admission, 3 days after treatment, 1 week after treatment and the time the last CT scan was obtained before discharge orthe completionof our research). Results Thirty patients (18 males and 12 females, age 20–74 years) with confirmed COVID-19pneumonia were evaluated. Increased neutrophilswere noted in 11 (36.7%) patients and decreased in 3 (10%) patients. Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) in 22 (73.3%) patients and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in 27 (90%) patient were observed, but elevation of procalcitonin was not obvious. Seven (53.8%) patients had elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).The presentation of CT opacities was mainly in the form of distribution in both the severe andmild groups. The mean PII score in the severe group was 58% and 13.7% in the mild group. The score in the severe group was more than 50%and less than 20%in the mild group at every milestone. The score in the severe group was always higher than the mild group, therefore, the severity of the disease may be positively correlated with PII score. Conclusion The pulmonary inflammation index (PII) score of chest CT scans correlated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) progression and could be used to indicate severity in patients.

As of February 25, 2020 there are 80,994 people infected and 2,760 deaths, and documented human-to-human transmission across multiple continents. At this time, no vaccine is available to control further dissemination of the disease. We have previously developed a synthetic DNA vaccine targeting the MERS coronavirus Spike (S) protein that was deployed in response to the MERS outbreak in South Korea. This vaccine induced potent antibody and CTL responses, and provided protection in a NHP challenge model. In the clinic, the vaccine generated humoral immunity including neutralizing antibody responses, as well as T cell immunity. Here we build on this prior work and report on the rapid development of a synthetic DNA-based vaccine targeting the major surface antigen Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.

            Background: In December 2019, the outbreak of a disease subsequently termed COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases increased rapidly and spread to six continents. However, there is limited information on the chest computed tomography (CT) characteristics of affected patients. Objective: Analyze COVID-19 patients to determine the relationships of clinical characteristics, chest CT score, and levels of inflammatory mediators . Methods: This retrospective, single-center case series of 108 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of HUST (Wuhan, China) was performed from January 1 to January 28, 2020. Patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical findings, chest CT results, and CT scores of affected lung parenchyma were recorded. The relationships between chest CT score with levels of systemic inflammatory mediators were determined. Results: All patients exhibited signs of significant systemic inflammation, including increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin, chest CT score, and a decreased lymphocyte (LY) count. Chest CT score had positive associations with white blood cell (WBC) count, CRP, ESR, procalcitonin, and abnormal coagulation function, and a negative association with LY count. Treatment with a glucocorticoid increased the LY count, reduced the CT score and CRP level, and improved coagulation function. Conclusions: COVID-19 infection is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response that affects the lungs, blood, digestive system, and circulatory systems. The chest CT score is a good indicator of the extent of systemic inflammation. Glucocorticoid treatment appears to reduce systemic inflammation in these patients.

        <p>
            There are few studies describing the presence of respiratory viruses in respiratory droplets and aerosols in the exhaled breath of infected persons, and the efficacy of facemasks as a source control to prevent respiratory virus transmission. Here, we recruited children and adults with acute respiratory illness and collected respiratory droplets and aerosols, with and without surgical facemasks. We identified human coronaviruses, influenza virus and rhinovirus from both respiratory droplets and aerosols. Surgical face masks reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in both respiratory droplets and aerosols, but only respiratory droplets and not aerosols for influenza virus RNA. Our results provide mechanistic evidence that surgical facemasks could prevent transmission of human coronavirus and influenza virus infections if worn by symptomatic individuals.Authors Donald K Milton and Benjamin J Cowling are joint senior authors.

            Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly recognized illness that has spread rapidly all over the world. Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from COVID-19 will bring high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Our study aims to identify in-hospital VTE risk and bleeding risk in COVID-19 patients. Methods We retrospectively studied 138 consecutively enrolled patients with COVID-19 and identified in-hospital VTE and bleeding risk by Padua Prediction Score and Improve bleed risk assessment model. The clinical data and features were analyzed in VTE patients. Results Our findings identified that 23 (16.67%) patients with COVID-19 were at high risk for VTE according to Padua prediction score, and 9(6.52%) patients were at high risk of bleeding for VTE prophylaxis according to Improve prediction score. Fifteen critically ill patients faced double high risk from thrombosis (Padua score more than 4 points in all 15[100%] patients) and hemorrhage (Improve score more than 7 points in 9[60.0%] patients). Thrombotic events were identified in four patients (2.9%) of all COVID-19 patients. All of them were diagnosed as deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound after 3 to 18 days after admission. Three (75.0%) were critically ill patients, which means the incidence of VTE among critically ill patients was 20%. One major hemorrhage was happened in critically ill patients during VTE treatment. Conclusion Critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffered both high risk of thrombosis and bleeding risks. More effective VTE prevention strategies based on an individual assessment of bleeding risks were necessary for critically ill patients with COVID-19.

        <p>
            A novel coronavirus was recently discovered and termed SARS-CoV-2. Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which, at this point, over 80,000 cases resulting in over 2,500 deaths have been reported in over 40 countries. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses. However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-19 infection and reveal that drugs targeting pathways prevent viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell culture model for infection with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Employing this system, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 infection profile by translatome and proteome proteomics at different times after infection.These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways, such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism. Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways were tested in cellular infection assays and prevented viral replication. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication. We anticipate our results to guide efforts to develop therapy options for COVID-19.Authors Denisa Bojkova, Kevin Klann, and Benjamin Koch contributed equally to this workData associated with the preprint has been made available on the authors' website.

        <p>
            The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a severe threat for public health and economy throughout the world. The structure of corona virus is composed of RNA based proteins that contains amino (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups.  It includes nucleocapsid protein (N-protein), spike protein (S-protein), envelope and hemagglutinin-esterase dimer (HE). These proteins affect adversely on human gastrointestinal system, heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system leading to several organ damages. This investigation reveals that the extracted components of natural plants, especially hydroxyl (-OH) groups react chemically to deactivate the active components of the virus by esterification   process. As a case study, using one of the natural resources, as for example, licorice (<italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>) which has the components of glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetic acid, liquiritin and isoliquiritin that can be used to neutralize the activeness of COVID-19 and it can be used as an antiviral drug. The extracted licorice is further processed with PVA solution to form antiviral nano-membrane for potential application as wound dressing materials, musk, gloves and against skin infection by electrospinning.  The morphology of the membrane is characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The research suggests that the other plants having deactivate components against virus can be applicable to resolve the human health crisis of the globe.

        <p>
            Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is a novel beta coronavirus emerged in China in 2019. Coronavirus uses spike glycoprotein to interact with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and ensure cell recognition. High infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 raises questions on spike-ACE2 binding affinity and its neutralization by anti-SARS-CoV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Here, we observed Val-to-Lys417 mutation in the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, which established a Lys-Asp electrostatic interaction enhancing its ACE2-binding. Pro-to-Ala475 substitution and Gly482 insertion in the <bold>A</bold>GSTPCN<bold>G</bold>V-loop of RBD hindered neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by anti-SARS-CoV mAbs. In addition, we identified unique and structurally conserved conformational-epitopes on RBDs, which can be potential therapeutic targets. Collectively, we provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and development of new effective neutralizing agents.

        <p>
            Background: Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase reactant downstream of the pro-inflammatory cytokines released during virus infection. However, the role of this inflammatory marker in SARA-CoV-2 infection is yet to be elucidated. Here, we explored the potential use of SAA in serum as a biomarker for monitoring the clinical course of COVID-19 patients.Methods: The subjects included 95 COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital with acute and / or convalescent phases data, among them 69 patients had paired data. Mann-Whitney U statistics and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare SAA level in the acute and convalescent phases. A subgroup of COVID-19 patients (n=9) participated in a follow-up examination with repeated blood collection reach five times during the hospitalization. The correlations of SAA levels with laboratory testing were then analyzed using the Spearman test.Results: The results of the data analysis show that the media SAA levels at acute phases were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) compared to that at baseline. Furthermore, ascensional range of SAA were associated with the degree of COVID-19 severity. Media SAA levels at convalescent phases were significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) compared to that at acute phases. The same phenomenon was seen in patients with and without comorbidities and with fever patients except without fever patients. Furthermore, The SAA concentration change in 9 COVID-19 patients of longitudinal follow-up along with the CT score and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid change. In the course of the disease, SAA changes were greater than CRP, lymphocytes, and neutrophils.Conclusions: The serum SAA levels were found to be significantly correlated with impending course of the COVID-19, and may serve as a useful biomarker to monitor the complicated clinical course of the disease.

The clinical severity and outcome variables were also recorded.Results: From February 10 to February 28 2020, 241 patients were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, 180 (74.7%) had hypocalcemia on admission. The median serum calcium levels were 2.12 (IQR, 2.04-2.20) mmol/L, median parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were 55.27 (IQR, 42.73-73.15) pg/mL, median 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (VD) levels were 10.20 (IQR, 8.20-12.65) ng/mL. The serum calcium levels were significantly positive correlated with VD levels (P =0.004), whereas negative correlated with PTH levels (P = 0.048). Patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially ≤2.0 mmol/L) had worse clinical parameters, higher incidence of organ injury septic shock and higher 28-day mortality. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, and 28-day mortality were 0.923 (P &lt;0.001), 0.905 (P =0.001), and 0.929 (P &lt;0.001), respectively. The overall mortality of COVID-19 was 4.1% (10/241), whereas the mortality of critical patients was up to 40.0% (10/25). Conclusions: Serum calcium was associated with clinical severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced VD and PTH.

            Background Compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome(MESR), Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) spread more rapidly and widely. The population was generally susceptible. However, reports on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were very limited. By sharing the clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 18 patients with COVID-19 during late pregnancy, we hoped to provide some references for obstetric treatment and management. Methods: A total of 18 patients with COVID-19 treated in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, chest CT and pregnancy outcomes were performed for analysis. Results: 1.18 cases of late pregnancy infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were delivered at 35 + 5 weeks to 41 weeks. According to the clinical classification of COVID-19, 1 case was mild type, 16 cases were ordinary type, and 1 case was severe type. 2 . According to Imaging examinations: 15 (83%) cases showed unilateral or bilateral pneumonia, 2 (11%) cases had pulmonary infection with pleural effusion, and 1(6%) case had no abnormal imaging changes. 3. Among the 18 newborns, there were 3 (17%) premature infants, 1 (6%) case of mild asphyxia, 5 (28%) cases of bacterial pneumonia, 1 (6%) case of gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 (6%) case of necrotizing enteritis, 2 (11%) cases of hyperbilirubinemia and 1 (6%) case of diarrhea. All the newborns were negative for the first throat swab test of SARS-CoV-2 after birth. 4. Follow-up to Mar 7, 2020, no maternal and neonatal deaths occurred. Conclusions: The majority of patients in late term pregnancy with COVID-19 were of ordinary type, and they less likely developed into critical pneumonia after early isolation and antiviral treatment. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not detected, but the proportion of neonatal bacterial pneumonia was higher than other neonatal diseases in newborns.

Real-time RT-PCR is widely deployed in diagnostic virology. However, the positive detection rates of RT-PCR are only 30% to 50%.

        <p>
            A novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. COVID-2019 was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-CoV. But the infection rate of COVID-2019 is much higher than SARS-CoV. The biophysical and structural evidence showed that the COVID-2019 binds ACE2 with 10~20 times affinity than SARS-CoV. TMPRSS2 cleaves ACE2 and facilitates the entry of the virus into host cells. The presence of SLC6A19 may block the access of TMPRSS2 to the cutting site on ACE2 and weaken the entry of COVID-2019 into host cells. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 expression in the nasal, mouth, lung, and colon tissues. We find that the number of ACE2-expressing cells in the nasal and mouth tissues is comparable to the number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung and colon tissues. We also find that ACE2 tends to be co-expressed with TMPRSS2 and not co-expressed with SLC6A19 in the nasal and mouth tissues. With the results, we infer that nasal and mouth tissues may be the first host cells of COVID-2019 infection. In our previous report in medRxiv and a recurrent report in New England Journal of Medicine, the COVID-2019 load tends to be higher in the nasal-swabs than in throat-swabs. We believe the roles of nasal and mouth tissues in COVID-2019 infection should be investigated, and we need to pay more attention to protect nose and mouth from COVID-2019 infection.

Methods: SIR model for novel coronavirus-infection transmission process was built based on the data of the infected persons, discharged patients and discharged patients during the period of isolation and control in Wuhan. Least squares estimation method was used to estimate the key parameters of the model. Results: The changing trend of the predicted value of SIR model was basically consistent with the actual value, and fitting effect was well. Based on the prediction results of model, future development trend of the epidemic showed that the inflection point of the epidemic was the 38th day, namely at the end of February, the peak number of infected persons was about 22000 (excluding clinical diagnosis cases); Different infection intensity and removal intensity had an impact on the development of the epidemic. Conclusion: The SIR model for novel coronavirus-infection transmission process in Wuhan has high veracity. Through the prediction and application of the model, it can provide guidance and advice for the actual epidemic prevention and control, and take effective measures to control the epidemic situation in time.

        <p>
            Emerging highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoV) are a global public health threat due to the potential for person-to-person transmission and higher mortality rates than common seasonal respiratory pathogens. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012, causing lethal respiratory disease in approximately 35% of human cases. Primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection are needed to support development of therapeutics or vaccines, but few models exist that recapitulate severe disease signs. For initial development of a MERS-CoV primate model, twelve African green monkeys (AGMs) were exposed to 103, 104, or 105 PFU target doses of aerosolized MERS-CoV. We observed a dose-dependent increase of respiratory disease signs and viral titers in serum and throat swabs between the 103 PFU and the 105 PFU dose groups, although all AGMs survived for the 28 day duration of the study. This study is the first to describe dose-dependent effects of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection of primates and uses a route of infection (small particle aerosol) with potential relevance to MERS-CoV transmission in humans. Aerosol exposure of AGMs may provide a platform for the development of primate models of novel coronavirus disease, with potential utility in therapeutic development and viral pathogenesis studies.

The structural superposition of the hepatitis C virus polymerase bound to sofosbuvir, a nucleoside analog antiviral approved for hepatitis C virus infections, with the SARS-CoV polymerase shows that the residues that bind to the drug are present in the latter. Moreover, a multiple alignment of several SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS-related coronaviruses polymerases shows that these residues are conserved in all these viruses, opening the possibility to use sofosbuvir against these highly infectious pathogens.

            Background The Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by 2019-nCoV is spreading worldwide, and by March 27, 2020, 199 countries, including Iran, have been affected. Prevention and control of infection is the most important priority for the public health. The behavior prediction of COVID-19 is an important problem. Methods In this research, we compared the different distributions of COVID-19 cases based on the daily reported data of Iran. We used 36 initial data on new cases and deaths with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection of Iran based on official reports from governmental institutes .We used the three types of continuous distribution known as Normal, Lognormal and Weibull. Results Our study showed that the weibull distribution was the best fit with the data. But the Parameters of distribution were different between new cases and daily deaths data. Conclusion According to the mean and median of the best fitted distribution, we can expect to pass the peak of the disease. The death rate is decreasing. We can see the similar behaviors of covid-19 in both Iran and China in the long run.

        <p>
            Background: The novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) has the novel coronavirus as its pathogen. At present, more than 30,000 medics from nationwide medical teams have supported Wuhan. However, some medical workers have been seriously infected in Wuhan and other parts of Hubei Province, with over 3,000 medical staff having been confirmed of infection. Therefore, it is necessary to analysis the emotional status of front-line medical staff and their influencing factors in dealing with the NCP so as to provide an objective basis for prevention and intervention measures. Methods: This research aimed to shed light on the relation between the personality characteristics of front-line medical workers and their anxiety and depression, to provide the basis and reference for targeted mental health education and for relevant departments to formulate relevant policies. This study adopted a convenient sampling method and examined the psychological status of 150 front-line medical workers from Zhejiang Province with questionnaire surveys using the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: The participants had severe anxiety and depression; the top three items under the category of anxiety were genitourinary symptoms, behavior at interview, and respiratory symptoms, whereas the top three items under depression were feelings of guilt, weight loss, and retardation. Among all personal data, the following factors influenced anxiety, in decreasing order: degree of suspicion of being infected when showing associated symptoms, degree of fear of yourself and your family being infected, and the affiliated hospital (P &lt;0.05). The first two factors similarly influenced depression (P &lt;0.05).      Conclusion: The front-line medical staff were found to have serious anxiety and depression when dealing with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, and have enormous psychological stress in the face of the growing number of confirmed cases and current absence of special treatment. Targeted mental health promotion work must be carried out to alleviate the psychological pressure of front-line medical staff and enhance their physical and mental health so that they can better contribute to the efforts against the current epidemic.

        <p>
            A novel SARS-like coronavirus (2019-nCoV) recently emerged from Wuhan, China and is quickly spreading in humans. A key to tackling this epidemic is to understand the virus’s receptor recognition mechanism, which regulates its infection, pathogenesis, and host range. 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV recognize the same host receptor ACE2. Here we determined the crystal structure of 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) (engineered to facilitate crystallization) in complex of human ACE2.Compared with SARS-CoV, an ACE2-binding ridge in 2019-nCoV RBD takes more compact conformations, causing structural changes at the RBD/ACE2 interface. Adaptive to these structural changes, several mutations in 2019-nCoV RBD enhance ACE2- binding affinity, contributing to the high infectivity of 2019-CoV. These mutations also reveal the molecular mechanisms of the animal-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. Alarmingly, a single N439R mutation in 2019-nCoV RBD further enhances its ACE2- binding affinity, indicating possible future evolution of 2019-nCoV in humans. This study sheds light on the epidemiology and evolution of 2019-nCoV, and provides guidance for intervention strategies targeting receptor recognition by 2019-nCoV.

        <p>
            <bold>Background</bold>: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was first diagnosed in December 2019, Wuhan, China. Little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people, therefore the development of an effective vaccine is highly desired.<bold>Methods</bold>: Immunoinformatics and statistical approaches were used in this study to forecast B- and T- cell epitopes for the SARS-COV-2 structural proteins (Surface glycoprotein, Envelope protein, and Membrane glycoprotein) that may play a key role in eliciting immune response against COVID-19. Different types of B cell epitopes (linear as well as discontinuous) and T cell (MHC class I and MHC class II) were determined. Moreover, their antigenicity and allergenicity were also estimated.<bold>Results</bold>: The antigenic B-cell epitopes exposed to the outer surface were screened out and 23 linear B cell epitopes were selected. “<bold>SPTKLNDLCFTNVY</bold>” had the highest antigenicity score among B cell epitopes. The T-cell epitopes bound to multiple alleles, antigenic, non-allergen, non-toxic, and conserved in the protein sequence were shortlisted. In total, 16 epitopes (9 from MHC class I and 7 from MHC class II) were selected. Among the T-cell epitopes, MHC class I (<bold>IPFAMQMAYRFN</bold>) and MHC class II (<bold>VTLACFVLAAVYRIN</bold>) were classified as strongly antigenic. Digestion analysis verified the safety and stability of the peptides predicted during this study. Furthermore, docking analyses of predicted peptides showed significant interactions with the HLA-B7 allele.<bold>Conclusion</bold>: The putative antigen epitopes identified in this study may serve as vaccine candidates and can help to eliminate/control growing health threat of COVID-19.

        <p>
            A particular problem at the beginning of the second millennium is the epidemic caused by coronaviruses. In 2002-2003, new strains of viruses appeared – SARS-CoV SARS, in 2012, MERS-CoV. In 2019-2020, the epidemic caused by the coronavirus strain 2019-nCoV, which belong to the Beta-CoV group, is a threat. Different types of coronaviruses infect humans, cats, birds, dogs, cattle, pigs and hares, bats, camels and other animals. Coronaviruses have a single-stranded RNA genome, which encodes 4–5 structural proteins, including proteins of the outer membrane, matrix and small membrane. The complete 2019-nCoV genome is stored online at GenBank: MN908947.3. Coronaviruses have some unique features in RNA transcription. The RNA minus chain serves as a matrix for the synthesis of both new genomic and subgenomic RNAs. To develop a model of human resistance to the disease caused by the coronavirus family, elements, connections and ways of protecting the Human-Virus-Environment system were identified. The destructive functions of sixteen non-structural and structural proteins of the strain 2019-nCoV are considered. Deterministic and statistical models of the development of the danger of infection of the cells have been developed. A parameterized system for protecting a person from coronavirus damage has been developed.

        <p>
            Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a recently discovered single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) betacoronavirus, responsible for a severe respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is rapidly spreading. Chinese health authorities, as a response to the lack of an effective therapeutic strategy, started to investigate the use of lopinavir and ritonavir, previously optimized for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS viral infection. Despite the clinical use of these two drugs, no information regarding their possible mechanism of action at the molecular level is still known for SARS-CoV-2. Very recently, the crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also known as C30 Endopeptidase, was published. Starting from this essential structural information, in the present work we have exploited Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD), an emerging computational technique that allows investigating at an atomic level the recognition process of a ligand from its unbound to the final bound state. In this research, we provided molecular insight on the whole interaction pathway of lopinavir, ritonavir, and nelfinavir, three potential C30 Endopeptidase inhibitors, with the last one taken into consideration due to the promising in-vitro activity shown against the structurally related SARS-CoV protease.

        <p>
            Background : The 2019 novel coronavirus disease is an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China in the end of Dec, 2019. The older patients complicated with underlying diseases are reported more likely to have clinical symptoms. But its secondary lesion is rarely reported. Case presentation : We reported two cases of coronavirus infected pneumonia with acute ischemic stroke in patients at their middle-age. In both 2019 coronavirus diseases cases, neurological physical examination are normal before infection. Lymphocytopenia and high expression of cytokines and D-dimer were found from serum clinical laboratory test at admission. The tongue palsy, dysarthria and limb muscle weakness are initial manifestations in one week after 2019 novel coronavirus infection. The head CT and head/neck arterial CTA showed small-vessel occlusion. The patients were diagnosed with coronavirus diseases with secondary acute ischemic stroke. They were treated with tirofiban and followed up with daily aspirin and atorvastatin. Conclusion : The present cases suggest that secondary ischemic stroke, which mainly manifested as small-vessel occlusion, should be considered for coronavirus disease patients with prompt diagnosis and treatment.

        <p>
            <bold> </bold>The current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths and has been declared to be a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization. There have been various disputes but the origin of COVID-19 is not clear. Here we analyzed the similarities of codon usage patterns between humans and pathogenic viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In HIVs, HPAIs, SARS, and MERS, codon usages are highly similar to that of humans; in contrast, the codon usage pattern of COVID-19 is drastically different from those of humans and other pathogenic viruses. Besides, coronaviruses have been evolving in two opposite directions: human-preferred codons are adopted to substitute less-preferred ones in SARS and MERS but are substituted by less-preferred ones in COVID-19. The unique codon usage pattern suggesting that COVID-19 was evolved in an intermediate host, in which its codon usage pattern becomes drastically different from that of bats or humans, and its pathogenicity is weakened compared with SARS ad MERS COVs. Finally, we appeal to international cooperation to eliminate the epidemic by cutting off the transmission routes among humans and to search for the origin and intermediate hosts of the novel coronavirus to prevent future animal-to-human transmission.

            With over 75762 patients infected and 2130 deaths been reported, the mortality and morbidity caused by the recent outbreak COVID-19 infections are proving colossal when compared to similar epidemics caused by SARS and MERS variant of coronavirus in the past. It was aimed to identify a receptor-binding domain (RBD) in surface glycoprotein (sGP) of COVID-19 and predict epitopes that are capable of interacting with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles to evoke antibody production <italic>in vivo</italic>. Bioinformatic computational tools were used to analyze the well-studied sGP and the RBD in SARS-CoV and compare it with their homologs in COVID-19. In silico methods that predict epitopes capable of binding MHC allele were used to identify sequences in RDB of sGP in COVID-19 with the intention of discovering sequences that can be used for vaccination and production of monoclonal antibody (mAbs) against COVID-19. The results indicate that COVID-19 has a conserved RBD in the sGP with differences in its sequences that can be exploited for vaccination and manufacturing of specific antibodies against this variant of coronavirus. Reported are 10 sequences of epitopes that are predicted to bind the MHC class I and class II alleles and that do not cross-react with human proteins.

Two dataset were obtained from the National Health Commission's open data information, and daily SARS epidemic section authorized by the State Council`s Information Office.<bold>Results: </bold>The 113 related studies finally entered final analysis, among which 63 were Chinese articles. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused outbreak in 2002 and 2019 in China called SARS and 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Both belong to Beta Coronavirus (β-CoV). Their original cluster confirmed cases had contact history to wild animals, and clinical symptoms are similar. However, COVID-19 has a high human-to-human transmission capability, and more rapidly spread from Hubei province (97.9% cases) across China and over the world. R0 was estimated around 2.2 (1.4-3.8), and incubation period of COVID-19 is 1-14 days. Transmission routes predominantly have respiratory droplets, close contact and even air transmission by aerosols. A fatality rate was 2.70% (2004/74185) with the highest of 14.8% at over 80 years old, and cases mainly were males in the middle and elder ages.

            Background The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) is currently ongoing in China. Most of the critically ill patients received high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). However, the experience of HFNC in this population is lacking. Methods We retrospectively collected the NCIP patients who received HFNC in two hospital of Chongqing, China from January 1st to February 18th, 2020. The clinical characteristics were collected. Patients who required upgrading to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) were defined as HFNC failure. Results We enrolled 17 patients in this study. Of them, 7 patients (41%) experienced HFNC failure (6 required upgrading to NIV, and one to NIV and further to intubation). The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0/6), 57% (4/7) and 75% (3/4) (p =0.03 between 3 groups) in patients with PaO2/FiO2 &gt;200, 150-200, and &lt;150 mmHg, respectively. In the successful patients, the respiratory rate, heart rate and PaO2/FiO2 significantly improved from initiation to termination of HFNC (27±3 vs. 21±2 breaths/min, p &lt;0.01; 86±15 vs. 76±12 beats/min, p =0.03; and 213±49 vs. 299±125 mmHg, p =0.04, respectively). However, in the unsuccessful patients, the respiratory rate and PaO2/FiO2 significantly deteriorated (22±3 vs. 25±3 breaths/min, p =0.04; and 160±27 vs. 105±24 mmHg, p =0.01, respectively). When they upgraded to NIV, the PaO2/FiO2 improved after 1-2 h of NIV (105±24 vs. 202±111 mmHg, p =0.04). In the total cohort, only PaO2/FiO2 at baseline was lower in unsuccessful patients than that in successful ones (213±49 vs. 160±27 mmHg, p =0.02). Conclusions This study firstly provides the experience of how to use HFNC in patients with NCIP. Patients with lower PaO2/FiO2 were more likely to experience HFNC failure.

        <p>
            To trace the evolution of coronavirus and reveal the possible origination of the novel pneumonia coronavirus (2019-nCoV), we collected and thoroughly analyzed 2966 publicly available coronavirus genomes, including 182 2019-nCoVs strains. We observed 3 independent recombination events with statistical significance between some isolates from bats and pangolins. In consistence with previous records, we also detected the putative recombination between Bat-CoV-RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV-2019 covering the receptor bind domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein (S protein), which may lead to the origination of 2019-nCoV. Population genetic analyses give estimations indicating that the recombinant region around RBD is possibly undergoing directional evolution. This may result to the adaption of the virus to be infectious in hosts. Not surprisingly, we find that the S protein of coronavirus keeps high diversity among bat isolates, which may provide a genetic pool for the origination of 2019-nCoV.

            <bold>Background</bold>The outbreak of a novel coronavirus since December 2019 in Wuhan, became an emergency of major international concern. As of March 5, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has caused 80,565 confirmed infections with 3,015 fatal cases in China. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. In our clinic, we found a rare case that a COVID-19 patient combined with ischemic stroke.<bold>Case Presentation</bold>A 79-year-old man was admitted to the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Chinese Traditional Medicine due to right limb weakness for 1 day and slight cough for 1 week. At presentation, his body temperature was 37.3°C (99.0°F) with some moist rales. Neurological examination showed right limb weakness, and the limb muscle strength was grade 4. The left leg and arms were unaffected. In addition, runs of speech were not fluent enough with tongue deviation. Laboratory studies showed lymphopenia and eosinophilic granulocytopenia. Chest CT revealed bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, with a peripheral lung distribution. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from throat swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. This patient was treated with antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs with supportive care until his discharge. Clopidogrel (75 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) were administered orally to treat acute ischemic stroke. After twelve days of treatment, he can walk normally and communicate with near fluent language.<bold>Conclusion</bold>We report an even more unusual case, a patient who was hospitalized for right limb weakness and was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Here, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused hypoxemia and excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the occurrence and development of ischemic stroke.

        <p>
            The possibility of using miRNA (mRNA-inhibiting RNA) to inhibit infections caused by the coronaviruses COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV has been shown. Using bioinformatics approaches, completely complementary miRNA (cc-miRNA) complexes were predicted to be able to bind and inhibit the translation of coronavirus proteins and the replication of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV genomes. For complexes of seven cc-miRc for COVID-19, seven cc-miRs for SARS-CoV, and eight cc-miRm for MERS-CoV, the interactions with the RNA genomes (gRNAs) of the corresponding coronaviruses was evaluated. The free energy of the interactions of cc-miRNAs with binding sites was significantly higher than the free energy of the interactions with other regions in gRNA, which ensures high selectivity of the binding of cc-miRNAs. Weak binding of cc-miRNAs to the mRNAs of 17508 human genes was shown, which suggests the absence of side effects of the cc-miRNAs in humans. A feature of this method is the simultaneous inhibition of translation and replication by several cc-miRNAs binding from the 5' end to the 3' end of gRNA. The use of several cc-miRNAs to suppress infections allows each of them to be used at a lower concentration to avoid side effects when one cc-miRNA is introduced into humans at a high concentration.

        <p>
            Among the prominent clinical symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, fever, and cough, 2019-nCoV infected individuals often experience hyposmia/anosmia (decrease or loss of sense of smell). Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key host receptor has now been established as an important moiety for the entry of 2019-nCoV into the host cells. A multitude of studies estimated the expression of <italic>ACE2</italic> in multiple organs including heart, kidney, intestines, lungs, buccal cavity, etc. The ongoing medical examinations and the autopsy reports of the diseased individuals strongly corroborate these organ/tissue-level molecular insights. Olfactory mucosa harbors multiple functionally distinct cell types. Zeroing in on the cell lineages that underpin infection associated loss of olfaction may provide new leads for diagnostics/clinical management of 2019-nCoV infected individuals. Our pointed bioinformatic analysis of single-cell expression profiles underscored selective expression of <italic>ACE2</italic> in a subset of horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and sustentacular cells (SUSs) of the olfactory mucosa in humans. Inspection of the <italic>ACE2</italic> levels in the olfactory mucosa of 4 additional mammalian species revealed comparable expression patterns, indicating the risk of olfactory dysfunction in these species. In summary, our findings pinpoint the molecular rationale of loss of smell in 2019-nCoV infected patients.

            Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, owing to the uncertain nature of COVID-19, can cause concerns about the potential health risks and may engender fear, anxiety, depression and so on. China is a multi-ethnic society, and Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture is a multi-ethnic residential city and is influenced profoundly by Islamic culture. Culture can influence perceptions, but it is unknown how much it affects frontline nurses’ perceptions of the emerging infectious disease outbreak. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological characteristics of nurses with minority ethnic backgrounds in response to the public health crisis and to explore its related factors. Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional online survey in the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu province, China. There were eight secondary-level hospitals and one tertiary-level hospital, six of which were COVID-19-designated hospitals. The structured questionnaire consisted of demographic questionnaire, COVID-19 related questionnaire, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and Self-rating Depression Scale. Results: A total of 1569 nurses enrolled in our online survey. The majority of the nurses were women (98.8%), aged younger than 40-year-old (90.3%), holders of a junior college degree (59.5%), married (74.6%), needed to care for children (63.9%) or elders (84.6%), with working years of less than 10 years (61.9%), and worked at non-high exposure departments(75%) in secondary hospital (66.9%) or COVID-19-designated hospital (85.4%). The anxiety and depression level (M± SD) were 42.56±8.95 and 46.52 ±11.883, respectively. The factors associated with psychological variables were social support, family role, fear of contagion, the desire to learn knowledge about COVID-19, and so on. Conclusion: Nurses who are of the Islamic culture are affected slightly by the COVID-19 outbreak, but their concern and factors associated with psychological variables are in keeping with the common nursing groups.

In our report, we found the asymptomatic is still shedding virus for at least 29 days. Therefore, we suggested that for individuals who had close contact with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 patients, in addition to isolation, medical observation, and further related testing if clinical symptoms appear in the observation period, it is best to collect nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens and test for COVID-19 nucleic acid as early as possible. The purpose of this active detection is to screen out COVID-19 asymptomatic patients, and to avoid further transmission through recessive source of infection. Our findings will facilitate understanding of asymptomatic COVID-19 and improve prevention strategies against COVID-19 transmission.

            Background: Modern researches have focused the attention towards the potential advantage of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel appeared coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has been frequently used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Which is useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The scientific community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the field of antiviral research. Methods: In the view of current situation efforts of international health professionals have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. It is mandatory to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2. Since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.Results: Chloroquine has been shown to be capable of inhibiting the in vitro replication of several coronaviruses. Recent publications support the hypothesis that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can improve the clinical outcome of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

            PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has quickly spread around the globe. Health care facilities in the United States currently do not have an adequate supply of COVID-19 tests to meet the growing demand. Imaging findings for COVID-19 are nonspecific but include pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities in a predominantly basal and peripheral distribution.METHODS: Three patients imaged for non-respiratory related symptoms with a portion of the lungs in the imaged field.RESULTS: Each patient had suspicious imaging findings for COVID-19, prompting the interpreting radiologist to suggest testing for COVID-19. All 3 patients turned out to be infected with COVID-19 and one patient is the first reported case of the coincident presentation of COVID-19 and an intraparenchymal hemorrhage.CONCLUSION: Using imaging characteristics of COVID-19 on abdominal or neck CT when a portion of the lungs is included, patients not initially suspected of COVID-19 infection can be quarantined earlier to limit exposure to others.

            Background: The new coronavirus disease COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has spread by human-to-human transmission to other areas. This study evaluated the transmissibility of the infectious disease and analyzed its association with temperature and humidity, in order to put forward suggestions on how to suppress the transmission. Methods: In this study, we revised the reported data in Wuhan to estimate the actual number of confirmed cases. Then we used the equation derived from the Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) model to calculate R0 from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in 11 major cities in China for comparison. With the calculation results, we conducted correlation analysis and regression analysis between R0 and temperature and humidity to see the impact of weather on the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results: It was estimated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases had exceeded 45,000 by February 13, 2020 in Wuhan. The average R0 in Wuhan was 2.7011, significantly higher than those in other cities ranging from 1.7762 to 2.3700. The inflection points in the cities outside Hubei Province were between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2020, while there had not been an obvious downward trend of R0 in Wuhan. R0 negatively correlated with both temperature and humidity, which was significant at the 0.01 level. Conclusions: The transmissibility of COVID-19 was strong and importance should be attached to the intervention of its transmission especially in Wuhan. According to the correlation between R0 and weather, the spread of disease will be suppressed as the weather warms.

        <p>
            Since December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused world-wide turmoil in less than a couple of months, and the infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is spreading at an unprecedented rate. AI-driven tools are used to identify Coronavirus outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread, where imaging techniques are widely used, such as CT scans and chest X-rays (CXRs). In this paper, motivated by the fact that X-ray imaging systems are more prevalent and cheaper than CT scan systems, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which we call Truncated Inception Net, is proposed to screen COVID-19 positive CXRs from other non-COVID and/or healthy cases. To validate our proposal, six different types of datasets were employed by taking the following CXRs: COVID-19 positive, Pneumonia positive, Tuberculosis positive, and healthy cases into account. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.96% (AUC of 1.0) in classifying COVID- 19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia and healthy cases. Similarly, it achieved an accuracy of 99.92% (AUC of 0.99) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia, Tuberculosis and healthy CXRs. To the best of our knowledge, as of now, the achieved results outperform the existing AI-driven tools for screening COVID-19 using CXRs.

Data from 2019-nCoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) were obtained from World Health Organization. Only confirmed cases and deaths directly attributed to these viruses were considered. For 2019-nCoV, severe illness was also considered. Two endpoints of interest were analysed: trends in fatality rate (death among confirmed cases x 100) and virulence rate (severe illness among confirmed cases x 100).<bold>Results</bold>The 2019-nCoV fatality and virulence rate decreased 1.0 and 7.3 percent points during the analysed time-frame, respectively. The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV fatality rate are five and 17 times higher than the current 2019-nCoV fatality rate. The current cumulative 2019-nCoV confirmed cases exceeded 3.5 and 11.3 times the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV confirmed cases, respectivelly.<bold>Conclusions</bold>A reduction in fatality and virulence rate associated with the novel coronavirus was observed in the analyzed time-frame. The novel coronavirus is spreading at higher rates than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although with comparative lower fatality rates.

For blood count, significant increase was noticed in neutrophil percentage (67.6% [IQR: 61.8-76.4] vs. 86.7% [IQR: 82-92.35], P&lt;0.01) and neutrophil count (3.75*10^9/L [IQR: 3.42-4.93] vs. 8.11*10^9/L [IQR: 5.675-8.905], P&lt;0.05); and decrease was seen in lymphocyte percentage (22.7% [IQR: 17.4-27.4] vs. 8% [IQR: 4.85-13], P&lt;0.05), lymphocyte count (1.62*10^9/L [IQR: 0.7-1.73] vs. 0.68*10^9/L [IQR: 0.385-1.04], P&lt;0.05), and platelet count (214*10^9/L [IQR: 184-247] vs. 147*10^9/L [IQR: 126-202.5], P&lt;0.05). Conclusions The serum levels of CRP, PCT and ferritin are markedly increased in very severe compared with severe COVID-19. Increased CRP, PCT and ferritin level might correlate to secondary bacterial infection and associated with poor clinical prognosis.

        <p>
            At least three months have been passed since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory disease, COVID-19 in Wuhan city, China in December 2019, caused by the infection of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.<sup>1,2</sup>. Due to its rapid spread throughout China and abroad, knowledge sharing for both its epidemiology and clinic manifestations is urgently need. Here we analyzed the clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shanghai. Genomic sequences assembled from 112 quality samples together with uploaded sequences in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) showed a stable evolution and suggested two major lineages with differential exposure history during the earliest outbreak in Wuhan. Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes. Lymphocytopenia, especially the reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts upon admission, was predictive of disease progression. High level of IL-6 and IL-8 during treatment was observed in severe and critical patients and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count. The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such age, lymphocytopenia and its associated cytokine storm whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect the outcomes. This comprehensive analysis on the molecular, immunological and clinical data provides a panorama of the key determinants related to the disease outcomes which should be helpful for improving the current combat against this extremely aggressive pandemic.Authors Xiaonan Zhang, Yun Tan, Yun Ling, Gang Lu, Feng Liu, and Zhigang Yi contributed equally to this work.

        <p>
            Background Newly emerged COVID-19 has been shown to engage the host cell ACE2 through its spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Here we show that natural phytochemical from a medicinal herb, Withania somnifera, have distinct effects on viral RBD and host ACE2 receptor complex. Methods We employed molecular docking to screen thousands of phytochemicals against the ACE2-RBD complex, performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and estimated the electrostatic component of binding free energy, along with the computation of salt bridge electrostatics. Results We report that W. somnifera compound, Withanone, docked very well in the binding interface of AEC2-RBD complex, and was found to move slightly towards the interface centre on simulation. Withanone significantly decreased electrostatic component of binding free energies of ACE2-RBD complex. Two salt bridges were also identified at the interface; incorporation of Withanone destabilized these salt bridges and decreased their occupancies. We postulate, such an interruption of electrostatic interactions between the RBD and ACE2 would block or weaken COVID-19 entry and its subsequent infectivity. Conclusion Our data, for the first time, show that natural phytochemicals could well be the viable options for controlling COVID-19 entry into host cells, and W. somnifera may be the first choice of herbs in these directions to curb the COVID-19 infectivity.

Lloyd-Sherlock, P. et al raise four concerns that needs to be considered when developing public health and clinical responses to COVID-19 to protect older adults in LMICs and this paper applies these concerns to the context of Sri Lanka and provides simple and immediate measures to proactively prevent the spread of COVID-19 among older adults in Sri Lanka. These measures include but does not limit to: 1) considering the difficulties health care system may face in the case of a COVID-19 surge and taking immediate preventative measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the country; 2) implementing measures in LTCs to prevent the spread among LTC residents and staff; 3) proactively including older adults especially those who are dependent and from remote areas in government responses; and 4) taking into considerations family dynamics unique to Sri Lanka and providing supportive measures to reduce exposure through government and other available resources. Sri Lanka being a LMIC and therefore more vulnerable, must take immediate actions to minimize the impacts COVID-19 could potentially have on the country, while there is still time.</jats:p>"

Applications include (i) control local outbreaks of COVID-19 via early stage home treatment, and (ii) lower the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in hospital ICU. Our prime objective is to propose a first line intervention measure with the potential to suppress proliferation of the viral infection across the respiratory system, thereby giving more time for proper immune system response and lowering the risk for aggravation and spread of the infection. We further discuss the available credible evidence for human safety consideration, by inhalation delivery, for facilitating immediate clinical trials. In addition, we discuss possible manufacturing and commercial availability of the method elements for near term wide public usage. Method : Based on previously published experimental data, on the antiviral effectiveness of colloidal silver, we propose a model method and computation for achieving antiviral MIC of silver particles in various respiratory system locations, by: (a) analysing the nanoparticle size dependent required concentration. (b) computing the required aerosol delivery characteristics. In order to compute the require delivery dosage, we take into account deposition fraction losses and also inhalation time fraction of the normal breathing cycle. We evaluate independent targeting of: (i) the trachea-bronchial tree (mucus volume of about 1cc), and (ii) the alveoli (total mucus volume of about 10cc). Results : The dosage is highly sensitive to the silver nanoparticle size, with 3nm - 7nm being the optimal size. Effective antibacterial MIC 10 μg/ml is estimated, but for more certainty 25 μg/ml is a reasonable target concentration to achieve in the mucus fluid of the respiratory system. In particular, using colloidal silver of 5nm particles, delivering inhalation of standard 5μ diameter droplets aerosol (e.g., using off-the-shelf ultrasonic mesh nebulizers), we assert that sufficient MIC can be achieved with: (i) depositing a total of just 0.25cc of a 100ppm (μg/ml) source concentration in the bronchial tree, and (ii) depositing a total of 1cc of a 250ppm (μg/ml) source concentration in the lungs alveoli. Yet, after accounting for deposition losses and due to the fact that active inhalation time is just about 1/3 of the breathing cycle, we find that that practical effective MIC can be achieved by these aerosolising dosages: (a) for the upper airways and bronchial tree use 2cc of a 100 μg/ml colloidal silver source, while (b) for lungs alveoli delivery use 6cc of a 200 μg/ml colloidal silver source. This would be reduced by a factor 3 if a breath actuated ultrasonic nebulizer is used. Conclusions : We conclude that effective MIC is achievable, both in the bronchial tree and in the alveoli (though the specific aerosol prescription may differ). Since respiratory infections start most commonly in the upper airways, it would be best to use the presented method early on as a first line treatment to suppress the progression of the infection. The required formulations are presently not available on the market but are easy to mass produce OTC in principle. Using off-the-shelf ultrasonic nebulizers and providable OTC colloidal silver formulations, we posit that our suggested method can be used precautionarily at home by anyone feeling the early signs of a potential infection. In addition, due to the anti-bacterial properties of colloidal silver, our method can serve in hospital intensive care units (ICU) as a new standard of care prophylactic treatment for ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP).</ns7:p>"

With additional informative priors from epidemiological models, bounds can be put on the true number of infected, permitting direct inference of covariates on the unseen infection rate. This retrospective model is useful for researchers in fields who are collecting increasing amounts of data about contextual factors, like government policies and political partisanship, that are related to the virus but who have no need or interest in forecasting the disease's spread. To apply the model, I show that as of March 30th, U.S. states with higher rates of cardiovascular deaths are associated with more rapidly rising COVID-19 infection rates, while a state's vote share for Donald Trump in the 2016 election is not.</p>"

Where are the randomized trials of social distancing? We trust the science on social distancing. Let us trust the science on the community use of face masks.

We analyze the contribution of  two  key  determinants  of  the  variation  in  the  observed  CFR:  the  age-structure  of  diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19  by  age  for  China,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  South  Korea,  Spain,  and  the  United  States.  We calculate the CFR for each country at the latest data point and for  Italy  also over time. We use demographic  decomposition  to  break  the  difference  between  CFRs  into  unique  contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality.  CFRs  vary  from  0.7%  in  Germany  and  1.6%  in  South  Korea  to  8.6%  in  Spain  and 10.6% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases can explain a substantial proportion of cross-country variation in the CFR. For example, 57% of Spain’s difference with respect to South Korea is explained by the observed cases being older. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 10.6%  between  March  9  and  March  29,  2020,  and  more  than  95%  of  the  change  was  due  to increasing age-specific case fatality rates. The  importance  of  the  age-structure  of  infected  cases  likely  reflects  several factors,  including  different  testing  regimes  and  differences  in  transmission  trajectories;  while increasing  age-specific  case  fatality  rates  indicate  the  worsening  health  outcomes  of  those infected  with  COVID-19.  Our  findings  lend  support  to  recommendations  for  data  to  be disaggregated  by  age,  and  potentially  other  variables,  to  facilitate  a  better  understanding  of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies  to  ascertain  the  extent  to  which  differences  in  testing  regimes  drive  differences  in  the age-structure of detected cases.</p>"

Yet it has already caused significant disruptions to the life of people across the country. The higher rate of confirmed cases and deaths have so far been concentrated in urban areas. However, it is only a matter of weeks for this lethal virus to reach remote and poor areas in the rural part of the country. When this happens, it will wreak havoc. This paper thus proposes a policy deriving from a risk assessment for local leaders from these areas. The expectation is that this strategy designed for impoverished and deprived areas can contribute to reduce the risk of the horrendous effects that this pathogen can have in these vulnerable communities and their fragile economies.</p>"

Trump’s policy inevitably leads to the decoupling between the U.S. and China, and the recent coronavirus outbreak may catalyze the decoupling process. In short term, the U.S. fiscal and monetary rescue plans may expose the national debt and deficit problems, hurting foreign countries’ confidence of the U.S. ability to pay its obligations. In long term, the U.S. has limited ability to stimulate economy without hurting the U.S. dollar’s supremacy; whereas China has a greater ability to coordinate fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate economy. May the decoupling continues, the U.S.-China capital war becomes inevitable and it may redefine the global currency landscape.</p>"

That is, perhaps, unless you work on open source software. Right now, global research communities are united to collaborate on solving the threat of the pandemic, sharing resources and knowledge more efficiently and effective than ever before, a process broadly described as ‘open scholarship’ (Dunleavy, 2020). This is essentially akin to how free and open source software (FOSS) communities have been operating now for decades (Willinsky, 2005). Recently, we participated in a “massively open online paper”, or MOOP, that explored the intersections between FOSS and open scholarship (Tennant, Agarwal, et al., 2020). Here, we want to summarise our key findings from that project, and place them in the context of the current outbreak. Critically, this pandemic shows us that many of the pervasive and systemic issues surrounding the evaluation, valuation, use and operationalisation of “openness” in scholarship can be extremely easily bypassed when the social demand and urgency is there, thus showing that the primary barriers towards open scholarship are inherently political and not technical.</p>"

coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Methods.--Based on the
susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the
assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before January 25,
2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the
basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed
cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of
infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological
determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results The
basic reproduction number falls between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time
reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China,
and falls between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected
cases from colleagues. Conclusions.--The early transmission ability of
2019-nCoV is closed to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable
disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control
measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions. Notes Added.--Using
a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the
estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0].

the basic reproductive number, $R_{0}$, of the virus have been identified by
fitting contagious disease spreading models to aggregated data. The data

stable. The increase appears to be roughly exponential, but with an e-folding
time that gradually increases from just two days at the end of January to about
ten days by February 9. Here we show that, since January 20, the number of

widely believed. At present, no departure from this behavior can be seen,
allowing tentative predictions to be made for the next 1-2 months. Contrary to
the usual exponential growth, a quadratic growth is the result of control
interventions. It can be explained by spreading on the periphery of a bulk

characteristics. According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory
pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the

details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of
people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work,
we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this
goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is
not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of
different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation
is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory
signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first
proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce
real-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with
bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify 6 clinically
significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots,
Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea). The proposed deep model and the modeling
ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such

previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate
the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free
methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson
distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According
to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for
controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission
of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring
Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to
end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence

province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the

Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five
consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified
uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth
model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here

presented and suggest an average range of 7,409-7,496 additional cases in Hubei

Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 -
38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 - 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020.
Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have
remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th -

the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as
inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based
strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such
as during large social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the
exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. With a basic
reproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected
person staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people.
Assuming the exposure time is 18 hours, the model recommends that attendees of

clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type
of pneumonia as soon as possible.This study aimed to establish an early
screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral
pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning
techniques. The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a
3-dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated
images were then categorized into COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and
irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence
scores using a location-attention classification model. Finally the infection
type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy-or
Bayesian function.The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the
overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.The
deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early
screening of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary
diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.

arXiv,NA,2002.09640v1,2020-02-22,The Outbreak Evaluation of COVID-19 in Wuhan District of China,"  There were 27 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases found in Wuhan, China in
December 2019, named as 2019-nCoV temporarily and COVID-19 formally by WHO on
11 February, 2020. In December 2019 and January 2020, COVID-19 has spread in
large scale among the population, which brought terrible disaster to the life
and property of the Chinese people. In this paper, we will first analyze the
feature and pattern of the virus transmission, and discuss the key impact
factors and uncontrollable factors of epidemic transmission based on public
data. Then the virus transmission can be modelled and used for the inflexion
and extinction period of epidemic development so as to provide theoretical
support for the Chinese government in the decision-making of epidemic
prevention and recovery of economic production. Further, this paper
demonstrates the effectiveness of the prevention methods taken by the Chinese
government such as multi-level administrative region isolation. It is of great
importance and practical significance for the world to deal with public health
emergencies.

then optimally docked to the 6LU7 monomer. Docking calculations show that
ligand-binding is strikingly similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 main proteases,
irrespectively of the protonation state of the catalytic CYS-HIS dyad. The most
potent docked ligands are found to share a common binding pattern with aromatic
moieties connected by rotatable bonds in a pseudo-linear arrangement. Molecular
dynamics calculations fully confirm the stability in the 3CL-pro binding pocket
of the most potent binder identified by docking, namely a
chlorophenyl-pyridyl-carboxamide derivative.

  Transportation Network: Beyond the Coronavirus in Wuhan","  Based on the SEIR model and the modeling of urban transportation networks, a
general-purpose simulator for the spread of epidemics in Chinese cities is
built. The Chinese public transportation system between over 340
prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with
layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail
routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities,
peripheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local
spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the
overlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different
transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the
transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation
vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the
infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the
recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be
used to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other
countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction
number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from
any Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective
government interventions are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to
trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from
empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. The
model is used to simulate the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan; it shows that
the framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public
city-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.

of the infection in a selected number of different Countries, by considering
well-known macroscopic growth laws, the Gompertz law, and the logistic law. We
also propose here a generalization of Gompertz law. Our data analysis permits
an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. The daily data
must be compared with the obtained fits, to verify if the spreading is under
control. From our analysis it appears that the spreading reached saturation in
China, due to the strong containment policy of the national government. In
Singapore a large growth rate, recently observed, suggests the start of a new
strong spreading. For South Korea and Italy, instead, the next data on new
infections will be crucial to understand if the saturation will be reached for
lower or higher numbers of infected individuals.

deaths worldwide, and the number of total infections is still rising. However,
the development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few

drugs against targeted proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that abacavir,
a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat HIV,
is predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of SARS-CoV-2.
Almitrine mesylate and roflumilast which are used for respiratory diseases such

COVID-19, which is spreading in China and many other countries. To avoid a
larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of
strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine
is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to
estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into
seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and
officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model
is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the
transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend
of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role
in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The
control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and
discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is
in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human
transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may
become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease
is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the
virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index
is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high
and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail
vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the
effectiveness of efficient vaccination. Once the vaccine comes into use, the
numerical simulation provide a promptly prospective research.

coronavirus (COVID-19) and SARS outbreaks to understand their epidemiological
characteristics. Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to
characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001)
unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al.
(2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)]
to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL
analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific
heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for
cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections,
suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter
(M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds
(COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health
interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the
infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and
below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0
coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19
outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection
threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality
rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity
UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of
coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed
from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of
infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of
which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health
interventions.

coronavirus affects contemporaneous economic sentiment. First, we collect a
global dataset on internet searches indicative of economic anxieties. We find
that the arrival of coronavirus in a country led to a substantial increase in
such internet searches of up to 58 percent. Second, leveraging two US
representative survey experiments conducted in early and mid-March 2020, we
document a rapid surge in economic anxieties after the arrival of the
coronavirus in the US. Third, to understand how information about the
coronavirus affects these anxieties, we measure perceptions about the
coronavirus. We find substantial heterogeneity in participants' beliefs about
the mortality from and contagiousness of the virus. Fourth, experimentally
providing participants with information about mortality and contagiousness
causally affects participants' worries regarding the aggregate economy and
their personal economic situation. Finally, we document that participants'
subjective mental models understate the non-linear nature of disease spread,
and that these mental models shape the extent of economic worries. These
results underscore the importance of public education about the virus for
successful containment as well as the need for timely measures that decrease
economic hardship and anxiety during a major global pandemic.

creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the
newly released coordinate structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and

Tipranavir>Indinavir>Atazanavir>Darunavir>Ritonavir>Amprenavir for HIV-1

of 78,824 confirmed CONID-19 cases and 2,788 deaths as of February 28, 2020.
Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of
the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic
prevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have
reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19
epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic
development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e.,
Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of
SARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the
existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the
situation of COVID-19. The prediction results of three different mathematical
models are different for different parameters and in different regions. In
general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three
models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be
better than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the

assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the
viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals
generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as
the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut
epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree
reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and
ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells
analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins
towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity.
Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway
epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly
enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways
might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral
pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral
infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the
Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the
compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and
ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2
infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral

Italy, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series
mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been
implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the
phenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide
reliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three
subcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the
evolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission
of the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the
effects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of
nearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in
Italy, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on
the others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an
error of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level,
instead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces
first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the
effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are
currently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the
spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent. Moreover, the proposed

Korea's rate of 0.76% (10 times lower than Italy) and China's 3.8% (50% lower
than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. There are some effective policies
that yield significant changes in the trend of cases. The lockdown policy in
China and Italy (the effect observed after 11 days), Shutdown of all
nonessential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined

  population in China","  Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of
the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental
ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all
transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results
for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating
the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel
flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial
fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they
appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,
creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These
movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population
concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the
return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us
to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New
Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread
of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of
keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring
intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These
results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national
distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective
control strategies at a national level.

  Smartphone Embedded Sensors: Design Study","  Coronaviruses are a famous family of viruses that causes illness in human or
animals. The new type of corona virus COVID-19 disease was firstly discovered
in Wuhan-China. However, recently, the virus has been widely spread in most of
the world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further, nowadays, all the
world countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID-19. There
are many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID-19 including
clinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed
COVID-19 patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly,
several techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such
as medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost and it
takes time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework
is proposed to detect coronavirus disease COVID-19 using onboard smartphone
sensors. The proposal provides a low-cost solution, since most of the
radiologists have already held smartphones for different daily-purposes. People
can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection purpose.
Nowadays, smartphones are powerful with existing computation-rich processors,
memory space, and large number of sensors including cameras, microphone,
temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour-sensor,
humidity-sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial
Intelligence (AI) enabled framework reads the smartphone sensors signal
measurements to predict the grade of severity of the pneumonia as well as
predicting the result of the disease.

arXiv,NA,2003.08086v3,2020-03-18,Tracking COVID-19 using online search,"  Online search data is routinely used to monitor the prevalence of infectious
diseases, such as influenza. Previous work has focused on supervised learning
solutions, where ground truth data, in the form of historical syndromic
surveillance reports, can be used to train machine learning models. However, no
sufficient data -- in terms of accuracy and time span -- exist to apply such
approaches for monitoring the emerging COVID-19 infectious disease pandemic
caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, unsupervised, or
semi-supervised solutions should be sought. Recent outcomes have shown that it
is possible to transfer an online search based model for influenza-like illness
from a source to a target country without using ground truth data for the
target location. The transferred model's accuracy depends on choosing search
queries and their corresponding weights wisely, via a transfer learning
methodology, for the target location. In this work, we draw a parallel to
previous findings and attempt to develop an unsupervised model for COVID-19 by:
(i) carefully choosing search queries that refer to related symptoms as
identified by a survey from the National Health Service in the United Kingdom
(UK), and (ii) weighting them based on their reported ratio of occurrence in
people infected by COVID-19. Furthermore, understanding that online searches
may be also driven by concern rather than infections, we devise a preliminary
approach that attempts to minimise this part of the signal by incorporating a
basic news media coverage metric in association with confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Finally, we propose a transfer learning method for mapping supervised COVID-19
models from a country to another, in an effort to transfer knowledge from areas
where the disease has a more extended progression.

  based study","  An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing
till December 2019. As of March 16 2020, It has caused an epidemic outbreak
with more than 1,79,073 confirmed infections and 7,074 reported deaths
worldwide. During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is
established and reported cases of coronavirus disease (COVID) are rising
worldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance for health care planning and
control the virus with limited resource. In this study, we propose and analyze
a compartmental epidemic model of COVID to predict and control the outbreak.
The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated
analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to
observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit
daily data from five provinces of China namely, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan,
Zhejiang and Hunan. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining
human-to-human spread ($R_0>1$, $R_c>1$) is already present in all the five
provinces. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID
cases is well captured by the model for all the five provinces. However, long
term predictions for Hubei reveals that the symptomatic COVID cases will show
oscillatory behaviour. Further, we found that effective management of
quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated
individuals to reduce the disease burden. Numerical results show that the
modification factor for quarantine, modification factor for isolation and
transmission rate are quite effective in reduction of the COVID cases in Hubei.
Thus, COVID is controllable by reducing contacts with infected people and
increasing the efficiency of quarantine and isolation. Health care officials
should supply medications, protective masks and necessary human resources in
the affected areas.

arXiv,NA,2003.08382v1,2020-03-18,Spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 epidemics,"  The new coronavirus known as COVID-19 is rapidly spreading since December
2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are
limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal
propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global
locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related
to population migration from Hubei resembling a L\'{e}vy flight which is
characteristic of human mobility. Our results also suggest that the disease
spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early
times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is almost constant
probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before
infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately
exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant
differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations.
While most Chinese cities control the disease which resulted in the decaying
stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse
probably due to less control.

identification and quarantine of the infected individuals, determination of
whom they have had close contact with in the previous days and weeks, and
decontamination of locations the infected individual has visited. Achieving
containment demands accurate and timely collection of the infected individual's
location and contact history. Traditionally, this process is labor intensive,
susceptible to memory errors, and fraught with privacy concerns. With the
recent almost ubiquitous availability of smart phones, many people carry a tool
which can be utilized to quickly identify an infected individual's contacts
during an epidemic, such as the current 2019 novel Coronavirus crisis.
Unfortunately, the very same first-generation contact tracing tools have been
used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most
private details about individuals. We seek to outline the different
technological approaches to mobile-phone based contact-tracing to date and
elaborate on the opportunities and the risks that these technologies pose to
individuals and societies. We describe advanced security enhancing approaches
that can mitigate these risks and describe trade-offs one must make when
developing and deploying any mass contact-tracing technology. With this paper,
our aim is to continue to grow the conversation regarding contact-tracing for
epidemic and pandemic containment and discuss opportunities to advance this

already been ""exported"" to more than 140 countries in all the continents,
evolving in most of them by local spreading. In this contribution we analyze
the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in
some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported.
Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an
exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem
to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out
recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down
with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic
was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries
like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other
European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first
countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems
to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most
affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local
case. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give
interpretations and possible explanations for them. The analysis and
conclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases,
are not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started.

arXiv,NA,2003.09093v2,2020-03-20,Masked Face Recognition Dataset and Application,"  In order to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus, almost everyone
wears a mask during coronavirus epidemic. This almost makes conventional facial
recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access
control, face access control, facial attendance, facial security checks at
train stations, etc. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the recognition
performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces.
Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep
learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present,
there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end,
this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face
Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD)
and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best
of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face
dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on
which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The
multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95%
accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry. Our datasets are

disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy. In the week
that followed, Lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of
cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the
first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western
Country. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of
confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds,
dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results,
hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction
number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than
February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the
epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The
median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of
positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care.
The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We
estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We
estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around
February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in
nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of
COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely
unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We
observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with
an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. Aggressive
containment strategies are required to control COVID-19 spread and catastrophic
outcomes for the healthcare system.

arXiv,NA,2003.09444v1,2020-03-20,On a quarantine model of coronavirus infection and data analysis,"  Attempts to curb the spread of coronavirus by introducing strict quarantine
measures apparently have different effect in different countries: while the
number of new cases has reportedly decreased in China and South Korea, it still
exhibit significant growth in Italy and other countries across Europe. In this
brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by
means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we
introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all
infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that
they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is
determined by the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of
newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different
compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\mathcal{R}_0 >1$, then the
number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if
$\mathcal{R}_0 <1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions
imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays
exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development
in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth
dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth).
Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection
(maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting
measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the
total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate
remains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced
quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.

arXiv,NA,2003.09861v1,2020-03-22,A SIDARTHE Model of COVID-19 Epidemic in Italy,"  In late December 2019, a novel strand of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing a
severe, potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) was identified in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and is causing outbreaks in multiple world
countries, soon becoming a pandemic. Italy has now become the most hit country
outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a
total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of
paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an
effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a
new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on
whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The
distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because
non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than
diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain
misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic
phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop
life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires
hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the
healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be
redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic
containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19
epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different
possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.

  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction","  In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019,
governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions
under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)
simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are
broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many
possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability
distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested
cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities
around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the
population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds
and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is
reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of
a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and
the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case
study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule
induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development
is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a
MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction
of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited
from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell
about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.

  SIR Model previously used in South Korea for the MERS outbreak","  The new coronavirus covid-19 has spread very quickly worldwide, leading the
World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a state of pandemic. One of the
questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the
spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR
model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also
caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases
in the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct
five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out
of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000
people on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective
and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South
Korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario
1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios
were devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\%
effectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the
transmission rate $\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\%, In this scenario
active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission
rate $\beta$ was reduced to 70\% of its initial value, in which the number of
cases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\beta$
was reduced to 80\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about
~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting
measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the
recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate
measures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully
that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.

arXiv,NA,2003.10086v1,2020-03-23,Eliminating COVID-19: A Community-based Analysis,"  We analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering the transmission of the
disease among individuals both within and between communities. A set of
communities can be defined as any partition of a population such that
travel/social contact within each community far exceeds that between them (e.g.
the U.S. could be partitioned by state or commuting zone boundaries). COVID-19
can be eliminated if the community-to-community reproductive number---i.e. the
expected/average number of other communities to which a single infected
community will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. We find that
this community-to-community reproductive number is proportional to the travel
rate between communities and exponential in the length of the time-delay before
community-level action is taken. Thus, reductions in travel and the speed at
which communities take action can play decisive roles in stopping the outbreak.
The analysis suggests that for the coronavirus to be eliminated, it is not
necessary to impose aggressive social distancing measures all over the world at
once, but rather only in communities in which active spreading is detected. The
sooner such measures are imposed, the shorter the duration they must remain in
place. If infected communities (including those that become re-infected in the
future) are quick enough to act, the number of actively infected communities
(and thus the number of communities in which such measures are required) will
exponentially decrease over time.

faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an
uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to
become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of
these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need
to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also

of Bergamo and Brescia shows a twofold aspect on the trend of the epidemic: -
all the data show a bias linked to the event of March 10th (day for which the
Lombardy region data is partial) and the subsequent change in the way in which
positive cases and deaths are calculated; - following the containment measures
of the Prime Minister's Decree of March 11th, the spread of the epidemic,
although still exponential in nature, has a reduced multiplication coefficient.
Our analysis concludes that the situation is not yet compatible with a plateau
trend and allows us to predict the trend in the number of deaths in the
Lombardy region. We therefore conclude that the containment measures put in
place by the government on March 11th will allow a reduction in deaths from
around 8000 to just over 6500 for March 27th.

arXiv,NA,2003.10532v2,2020-03-23,A simple iterative map forecast of the COVID-19 pandemic,"  We develop a simple 3-dimensional iterative map model to forecast the global
spread of the coronavirus disease. Our model contains only one fitting
parameter, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health
organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that
our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data. It
predicts that the disease will run its full course over six to seven months,
starting from the date on which the world health organisation provided the
first 'Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$ day 1). The disease may be
expected to infect approximately 24% of the global population, i.e. about 1.83
billion people, taking approximately 86 million lives. Unless drastic new
interventions become possible, the global number of new cases is predicted to
peak on day 129 (about the middle of May 2020), with an estimated 65 million
new cases per day. Since our simple model fits the available global data so
well, we suggest that the measures being taken so far to contain the pandemic
may be ineffective in curbing the global spread of the virus. As such, the
efficacy of these measures should be more carefully weighed against their
impact on the world economy.

  Case of Los Angeles","  The global spread of 2019-nCoV, a new virus belonging to the coronavirus
family, forced national and local governments to apply different sets of
measures aimed at containing the outbreak. Los Angeles has been one of the
first cities in the United States to declare the state of emergency on March
4th, progressively issuing stronger policies involving (among the others)
social distancing, the prohibition of crowded private and public gatherings and
closure of leisure premises. These interventions highly disrupt and modify
daily activities and habits, urban mobility and micro-level interactions
between citizens. One of the many social phenomena that could be influenced by
such measures is crime. Exploiting public data on crime in Los Angeles, and
relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime, this work
investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an
impact on crime trends in a metropolis. The article specifically focuses on
eight urban crime categories, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March
16th 2020. The analyses will be updated bi-weekly to dynamically assess the
short- and medium-term effects of these interventions to shed light on how
crime adapts to such structural modification of the environment. Finally,

China in the end of 2019. It has already affected more than 300,000 people,
with the number of deaths nearing 13000 across the world. As it has been posing
a huge threat to global public health, it is of utmost importance to identify
the rate at which the disease is spreading. In this study, we propose a time
series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID-19
outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown,
wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and
using appropriate diagnostic measures, we showed that a time-dependent
quadratic trend successfully captures the incidence pattern of the disease. We
also estimate the basic reproduction number across different countries, and
find that it is consistent except for the United States of America. The above
statistical analysis is able to shed light on understanding the trends of the
outbreak, and gives insight on what epidemiological stage a region is in. This
has the potential to help in prompting policies to address COVID-19 pandemic in

to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late
December 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways of

genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accurate
method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes.
The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard
distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis
of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations
are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method
serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic
viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis
shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase,
and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for
vaccine development in disease control.

infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the
updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of
this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net
to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.
Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study
is validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19
cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep
convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group
Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural
network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image
to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case.
Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully
done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases,
respectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models
showed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with
f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to
classify COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework.

lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize
automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest

45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,
from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the
whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are
calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity
(non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each
quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of

validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive
rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under

quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the
whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to

of undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking
into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters
determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using
data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is
capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of
confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The
drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different
countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as
the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the
occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating
its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that
insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented
infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that
country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model
predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did
not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is
that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a
non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been
deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently
imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving
into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting
the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the
hidden individuals.

around the world, specially in european countries like Italy and Spain. The
first reported case in Brazil was recorded in February 26, and after that the
number of cases growed fast. In order to slow down the initial grow of the
disease through the country, confirmed positive cases were isolated to not
transmit the disease. To better understand the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil,
we apply a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model to the
analysis of data from the Brazilian Department of Health. Based on analyical
and numerical results, as well on the data, the basic reproduction number is
estimated to $R_{0}=5.25$. In addition, we estimate that the ratio unidentified
infectious individuals and confirmed cases is about $10$, in agreement with
previous studies. We also estimated the epidemic doubling time to be $2.72$
days.

  spike glycoprotein: a potential hint at the possibility of local iron
  dysregulation in COVID-19","  The spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has
attracted attention for its vaccine potential and binding capacity to host cell
surface receptors. Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomain
of the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region,
followed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similarity
between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and
the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is
thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans. An implication of
this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation
in the COVID-19 research field making use of an already-established literature
on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, respiratory infections
and the hepcidin protein. The question of possible homology and an evolutionary
connection between the viral spike protein and hepcidin is not assessed in this

1,293 reported deaths in the United States; and the World Health Organization
(WHO) characterized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) - which has infected more

community transmission would represent a significant turn for the worse in the
battle against the novel coronavirus, which points to an urgent need for
expanded surveillance so we can better understand the spread of COVID-19 and
thus better respond with actionable strategies for community mitigation. By
advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and leveraging the
large-scale and real-time data generated from heterogeneous sources (e.g.,
disease related data from official public health organizations, demographic
data, mobility data, and user geneated data from social media), in this work,
we propose and develop an AI-driven system (named $\alpha$-Satellite}, as an
initial offering, to provide hierarchical community-level risk assessment to
assist with the development of strategies for combating the fast evolving
COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, given a specific location (either user
input or automatic positioning), the developed system will automatically
provide risk indexes associated with it in a hierarchical manner (e.g., state,
county, city, specific location) to enable individuals to select appropriate
actions for protection while minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent
possible. The developed system and the generated benchmark datasets have been

  Anomaly Detection","  Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. To date the novel
COVID-19 coronavirus is rapidly spreading worldwide and subsequently
threatening health of billions of humans. Clinical studies have shown that most
COVID-19 patients suffer from the lung infection. Although chest CT has been
shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis,
chest Xray is more widely available due to its faster imaging time and
considerably lower cost than CT. Deep learning, one of the most successful AI
techniques, is an effective means to assist radiologists to analyze the vast
amount of chest X-ray images, which can be critical for efficient and reliable
COVID-19 screening. In this work, we aim to develop a new deep anomaly
detection model for fast, reliable screening. To evaluate the model
performance, we have collected 100 chest X-ray images of 70 patients confirmed
with COVID-19 from the Github repository. To facilitate deep learning, more
data are needed. Thus, we have also collected 1431 additional chest X-ray
images confirmed as other pneumonia of 1008 patients from the public
ChestX-ray14 dataset. Our initial experimental results show that the model
developed here can reliably detect 96.00% COVID-19 cases (sensitivity being
96.00%) and 70.65% non-COVID-19 cases (specificity being 70.65%) when evaluated
on 1531 Xray images with two splits of the dataset.

have surfaced to deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon
catastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves splitting one ventilator
to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are
obvious risks and little is known on how the technique would work on patients
with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs
of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but
that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different
compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility
of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments
expanding on the previous studies with different ventilator setting and lung
characteristics. Using two test lungs connected to a ventilator, the tidal
volumes and pressures into both lungs were measured for different combinations
of lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory and
end-expiratory pressure levels. We found large discrepancies in delivered tidal
volumes for paired test lungs with compliance differences, little influence
from differences in airway resistances, and that higher PEEP settings could
strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. The most
balanced, although far from ideal, delivery of tidal volumes for the test lungs
with different compliance was measured using pressure-controlled ventilation
with a maximum inspiratory pressure of 30 mbar and a PEEP at 6 or 10 mbar. From
this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify
reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards
of the technique.

arXiv,NA,2003.12417v3,2020-03-27,Temperature dependence of COVID-19 transmission,"  The recent coronavirus pandemic follows in its early stages an almost
exponential expansion, with the number of cases as a function of time
reasonably well fit by $N(t)\propto e^{\alpha t}$, in many countries. We
analyze the rate $\alpha$ in different countries, choosing as a starting point
in each country the first day with 30 cases and fitting for the following 12
days, capturing thus the early exponential growth in a rather homogeneous way.
We look for a link between the rate $\alpha$ and the average temperature $T$ of
each country, in the month of the epidemic growth. We analyze a {\it base} set
of 42 countries, which developed the epidemic earlier, and an {\it extended}
set of 88 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently. Fitting with a
linear behavior $\alpha(T)$, we find evidence in both datasets for a decreasing
growth rate as a function of $T$, at $99.66\%$C.L. and $99.86\%$C.L. in the
{\it base} and {\it extended} dataset, respectively. In the {\it base} set,
going beyond a linear model, a peak at about $(7.7\pm 3.6)^\circ C$ seems to be
present in the data. Our findings give hope that, for northern hemisphere
countries, the growth rate should significantly decrease as a result of both
warmer weather and lockdown policies. In general the propagation should be
hopefully stopped by strong lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the
arrival of the next cold season.

mitigate the expected economic shocks. To achieve higher effectiveness with
cyclical and fiscal policy measures, it is key to identify the industries that

to measure the industry-specific risks related to COVID-19. We examine company
risk reports filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This
data set allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments. Preliminary
findings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business
risks is ahead of the overall stock market developments by weeks. The risk
reports differ substantially between industries, both in magnitude and in
nature. Based on natural language processing techniques, we can identify
corona-related risk topics and their perceived relevance for different
industries. Our approach allows to distinguish the industries by their reported
risk awareness towards COVID-19. The preliminary findings are summarised an
online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the industry-specific risk assessments
related to the crisis, as it spreads through the economy. The tracking tool
could provide relevant empirical data to inform models on the immediate
economic effects of the crisis. Such complementary empirical information could
help policy-makers to effectively target financial support and to mitigate the

general form of influence function differs from the commonly adapted

can learn the delayed influence of prior events, which is an aspect seemingly
largely ignored in prior literature. Prior knowledge or assumptions on the

convex constraints on the parameters specifying the influence function. We
develop two approaches for recovering these parameters, using the constrained

performance of our approach on synthetic examples and illustrate its promise
using real data (crime data and novel coronavirus data), in extracting
knowledge about the general influences and making predictions.

patients using digital x-ray images while maximizing the accuracy in detection
using image pre-processing and deep-learning techniques. A public database was
created by the authors using three public databases and also by collecting
images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 190

augmented training set was created with 2500 images of each category for
training and validating four different pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural

for both the schemes were 98.3%, 96.7%, 100%, 100% and 98.3%, 96.7%, 99%, 100%,

of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through
melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other
applications of audible coding of matter include material design by

systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining
associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web
of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data
were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary
data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion
criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men
were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with
women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group
compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for
male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of
ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based
immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is
positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly
regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an
increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,
which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular
compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell
receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified
as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in
men.

from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the
ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either.

self-quarantine may not be as efficient as strict social distancing in slowing
COVID-19 spread, if not all of the infected people can be promptly diagnosed
and quarantined.

arXiv,NA,2003.13932v3,2020-03-31,COVID-19: A model for studying the evolution of contamination in Brazil,"  In the present article we introduce an epidemiological model for the
investigation of the spread of epidemics caused by viruses. The model is
applied specifically to COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus
(aka ""novel coronavirus""). The SIR (Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered) model
is used as a basis for studying the evolution of the epidemic. Nevertheless, we
have modified some of the model hypotheses in order to obtain an estimate of
the contamination free of overestimated predictions. This extended model is
then applied to the case of the recent advance of the epidemic in Brazil. In
this regard, it is possible to obtain the evolution for the number of
infectious significantly close to that provided by current data. Accordingly,
we evaluate possible future scenarios for the disease spread. Regarding the
population susceptibility, we consider different social behaviors in response
to quarantine measures and precautions to avoid contagion. We conclude that the
future scenario of the epidemic depends significantly on the social behavior
adopted to date, as well as on the contagion control measures. The extent of
such measures would be likely to cause thousands, millions or tens of millions
of contaminations in the next few months.

  dynamical density functional theory model","  For preventing the spread of epidemics such as the coronavirus disease
COVID-19, social distancing and the isolation of infected persons are crucial.
However, existing reaction-diffusion equations for epidemic spreading are
incapable of describing these effects. We present an extended model for disease
spread based on combining an SIR model with a dynamical density functional
theory where social distancing and isolation of infected persons are explicitly
taken into account. The model shows interesting nonequilibrium phase separation
associated with a reduction of the number of infections, and allows for new
insights into the control of pandemics.

  Pandemic Scenario","  Since instances of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) community spread
emerged in the United States, federal and local governments have implemented
multiple containment measures. However, in order to satisfy the needs of
citizens, the strictest containment measures can be only executed for short
period. This article compares two types of containment strategies: a constant
containment strategy that could satisfy the needs of citizens for a long period
and an adaptive containment strategy whose strict level changes across time.
When to implement the strictest measures is also of interest. A prediction
model is proposed and a simple tool is developed for policy makers to compare
different containment strategies. As an example, a county with 2.8 million
population with initial 200 infectious cases is considered, where about 0.15%
people died during the pandemic. Compared with a constant containment strategy,
adaptive containment strategies shorten the outbreak length and executing the
strictest measures earlier will cause less mortality.

individually. If testing methodology is such that samples from multiple
subjects can be efficiently combined and tested at once, yielding a positive
results if any one subject in the subgroup is positive, then one can often
identify the infected sub-population with a considerably lower number of tests
compared to the number of test subjects. We present two such methods that allow
an increase in testing efficiency (in terms of total number of test performed)
by a factor of $\approx$ 10 if population infection rate is $10^{-2}$ and a
factor of $\approx$50 when it is $10^{-3}$. Such methods could be useful when
testing large fractions of the total population, as will be perhaps required
during the current coronavirus pandemic.

significant uncertainty, as expected with limited data and difficulties in case
ascertainment, but more reliable inferences can now be made. Here, we estimate
from European data that COVID-19 cases are expected to double initially every
three days, until social distancing interventions slow this growth, and that
the impact of such measures is typically only seen nine days - i.e. three
doubling times - after their implementation. We argue that such temporal
patterns are more critical than precise estimates of the basic reproduction
number for initiating interventions. This observation has particular
implications for the low- and middle-income countries currently in the early

spreading quickly across the world. Italy, that is widely considered one of the
main epicenters of the pandemic, registers the highest COVID-2019 death rates
and death toll in the world, to the present day. In this article I estimate an
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the epidemic
trend over the period after March 30, 2020, by using the Italian
epidemiological data at national and regional level. The data refer to the
number of daily confirmed cases officially registered by the Italian Ministry
of Health (www.salute.gov.it) for the period February 20 to March 30, 2020. The
main advantage of this model is that it is easy to manage and fit. Moreover, it
may give a first understanding of the basic trends, by suggesting the
hypothetic epidemic's inflection point. Obviously, data need a continuous
updating to better explain what is going on.

  Corona pandemic","  In response to the rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), with ten
thousands of deaths and intensive-care hospitalizations, a large number of
regions and countries have been put under lockdown by their respective
governments. Policy makers are confronted in this situation with the problem of
balancing public health considerations, with the economic costs of a persistent
lockdown. We introduce a modified epidemic model, the controlled-SIR model, in
which the disease reproduction rates evolve dynamically in response to
political and societal reactions. Social distancing measures are triggered by
the number of infections, providing a dynamic feedback-loop which slows the
spread of the virus. We estimate the total cost of several distinct containment
policies incurring over the entire path of the endemic. Costs comprise direct
medical cost for intensive care, the economic cost of social distancing, as
well as the economic value of lives saved. Under plausible parameters, the
total costs are highest at a medium level of reactivity when value of life
costs are omitted. Very strict measures fare best, with a hands-off policy
coming second. Our key findings are independent of the specific parameter
estimates, which are to be adjusted with the COVID-19 research status. In
addition to numerical simulations, an explicit analytical solution for the
controlled continuous-time SIR model is presented. For an uncontrolled outbreak
and a reproduction factor of three, an additional 28% of the population is
infected beyond the herd immunity point, reached at an infection level of 66%,
which adds up to a total of 94%.

definition of a social distancing function varying over time, to assess the
situation related to the spreading of the coronavirus Covid--19 in Italy and in
two of its most important regions, i.e., Lombardy and Campania. To profitably
use this model, the most suitable values of its parameters must be found. The
estimation of the SEIR--SD model parameters takes place here through the use of
Differential Evolution, a heuristic optimization technique. In this way, we are
able to evaluate for each of the three above-mentioned scenarios the daily
number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading, the
day(s) in which this number will be at its highest peak, and the day in which
the infected cases will become very close to zero.

world health organization. This novel virus leads to pneumonia, which is an
infection that inflames the lungs' air sacs of a human. One of the methods to
detect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a
pneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN)
with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be
presented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and
made it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images
from the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray
images with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10%

the efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet,
Squeeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect
the pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small
number of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the
complexity of the models and the consumed memory and time. Using a combination
of GAN and deep transfer models proved it is efficiency according to testing
accuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most

arXiv,NA,2004.00908v1,2020-04-02,Detecting Suspected Epidemic Cases Using Trajectory Big Data,"  Emerging infectious diseases are crucial threats to human health and global
stability. The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rapidly
formed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections and huge
economic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track, detect and
isolate infected people are among the most effective means to quickly contain
the outbreak. Based on trajectory big data and the theory of mean-field, we
establish an aggregated risk mean=field that contains information of all
risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk
map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency
enabling fast update. We then propose an objective personal epidemic risk
scoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps, and use it to develop
statistical inference based method and machine learning based method for
detecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical
experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of
COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in
capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be
applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community
levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as at hospital and
station. HiRES-p score is an effective measurement of personal epidemic risk.
The detection rates as de ned by successful classification are above 90% as
long as the population infection rate is under 20%, which indicates great
application potential in epidemic risk prevention and control practice.

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was first reported on in early December 2019 in
Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole
globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of
the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and
deaths for countries worldwide and for US counties and provide prima facie
evidence that it follows a power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able
to explain the origin of this scaling behavior by the superposition of two
concurrent processes: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and
the small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming
exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is
determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm
this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model,
describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our
theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within
a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the pandemic. By combining
real world data, modeling, and numerical simulations we make the case that that
the distribution of epidemic prevalence, and possibly that of spreading
processes in general, might follow universal rules.

arXiv,NA,2004.01252v1,2020-04-02,COVID-19: Should We Test Everyone?,"  Since the beginning of 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
spread rapidly in the city of Wuhan, P.R. China, and subsequently, across the
world. The swift spread of the virus is largely attributed to its stealth
transmissions in which infected patients may be asymptomatic. Undetected
transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus
and pose an appalling threat to the public. An urgent question that has been
asked by the public is ""Should I be tested for COVID-19 if I am sick?"". While
different regions established their own criteria for screening infected cases,
the screening criteria have been modified based on new evidence and
understanding of the virus as well as the availability of resources. The
shortage of test kits and medical personnel has considerably limited our
ability to do as many tests as possible. Public health officials and clinicians
are facing a dilemma of balancing the limited resources and unlimited demands.
On one hand, they are striving to achieve the best outcome by optimizing the
usage of the scant resources. On the other hand, they are challenged by the
patients' frustrations and anxieties, stemming from the concerns of not being
tested for COVID-19 for not meeting the definition of PUI (person under
investigation). In this paper, we evaluate the situation from the statistical
viewpoint by factoring into the considerations of the uncertainty and
inaccuracy of the test, an issue that is often overlooked by the general
public. We aim to shed light on the tough situation by providing evidence-based
reasoning from the statistical angle, and we expect this examination will help
the general public understand and assess the situation rationally. Most
importantly, the development offers recommendations for physicians to make
sensible evaluations to optimally use the limited resources for the best
medical outcome.

  public transport system","  The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus and its rapid spread underlines
the importance of understanding human mobility. Enclosed spaces, such as public
transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for
infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns
and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus
critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For
instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent
in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions
such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider
multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for
the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide
smart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus
passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the
distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate
disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We
investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while
varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our
results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions
simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different
groups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single
dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given
specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination
efforts.
